The staging investigations show no evidence of metastatic spread. The tumor is confined to the kidney but with evidence of local invasion into perinephric fat. Molecular testing has confirmed presence of KIT mutation.\n\nOn examination today, he is well with normal vital signs. Abdomen is soft and non-tender with no palpable masses. No peripheral edema.\n\nI have discussed the case with our uro-oncology MDT. Given the locally advanced nature but absence of metastatic disease, we recommend proceeding with right radical nephrectomy. I have explained the procedure, recovery process and potential complications. [redacted name] understands and wishes to proceed.\n\nPlan:\n1. Referred to [redacted name] for surgical assessment\n2. Pre-operative assessment to be arranged\n3. Follow up in combined surgical-oncology clinic in 2 weeks with surgical date",
