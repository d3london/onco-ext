His disease has unfortunately progressed following two cycles of first-line platinum-etoposide chemotherapy with new bone metastases identified on screening PET-CT dated 25/4/24. Brain MRI shows stable appearances post whole brain radiotherapy.\n\nHe meets all eligibility criteria for trial participation including adequate organ function, ECOG PS 2, and confirmed MYCN amplification on recent molecular testing. Trial requirements, schedule of assessments, and potential risks/benefits have been discussed in detail. Written informed consent has been obtained.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tBaseline ECG and ECHO completed today\nTrial protocol biopsies scheduled for 2/5/24\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tDexamethasone 4mg bd\nOndansetron 8mg bd prn\n\n\tFollow up\n\tCycle 1 Day 1 of trial treatment scheduled for 3/5/24\nWeekly trial assessments for first 28 days\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly FBC, U&E, LFTs as per trial protocol\nUrgent review if fever or new symptoms",
