She has completed 6 cycles of adjuvant modified FOLFIRINOX which finished on 15/4/24. Her post-chemotherapy CT scan shows no evidence of disease recurrence. Blood tests including CA19-9 are within normal range. She reports good energy levels with PS 0 and has returned to work full-time. The peripheral neuropathy that developed during chemotherapy has largely resolved. Her weight is stable at 68kg. The plan is for continued 3-monthly surveillance with next CT scan due in July 2024. She will be reviewed in clinic following those results.",
