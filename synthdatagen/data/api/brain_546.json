She remains clinically stable with no new neurological symptoms. Her most recent MRI from 15/5/24 shows post-treatment changes with no evidence of disease progression. She continues to manage well with levetiracetam 750mg BD with no seizures for 6 months. Her performance status remains 0 and she has returned to work full-time. Steroid dose has been successfully weaned and stopped. Plan for continued 3-monthly MRI surveillance with next scan due August 2024. Will review in clinic with scan results.",
