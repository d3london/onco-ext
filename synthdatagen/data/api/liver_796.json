  "content": "Diagnosis:\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma, Stage IVB\nInitial diagnosis January 2024\nWidespread metastatic disease affecting lungs, bone, and peritoneum\nAFP at diagnosis 40,000 kU/L, MSI-high status confirmed\n\nPrevious medical history:\nChild-Pugh B cirrhosis (alcohol-related)\nType 2 diabetes\nHypertension\n\nCurrent medications:\nAtezolizumab 1200mg q3weekly\nBevacizumab 15mg/kg q3weekly\nSpironolactone 100mg daily\nFurosemide 40mg daily\nMetformin 1g BD\nRamipril 5mg daily\n\nAllergies:\nNone documented\n\nCurrent situation:\nProgressive disease after cycle 4 immunotherapy\n\nCT 15 April 2024 shows:\n- New peritoneal deposits\n- Increasing size of pulmonary metastases\n- New T12 vertebral metastasis with impending cord compression\n- Stable primary liver lesion\n\nAFP rising to 65,000 kU/L\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who has unfortunately experienced significant clinical deterioration over the past 3 weeks. His performance status has declined from ECOG 1 to ECOG 3, now spending most of the day in bed due to severe fatigue and increasing bone pain. He reports worsening right upper quadrant pain requiring increased opiate analgesia, and new onset dyspnea even at rest. His appetite has significantly decreased with 6kg weight loss over the past month.\n\nOn examination, there is marked hepatomegaly extending 6cm below the costal margin, moderate ascites, and decreased air entry at both lung bases. There is new focal tenderness over the T12 vertebra. Blood pressure is 95/60 with postural drop.\n\nGiven the clear radiological and biochemical disease progression, with significant clinical deterioration, we have made the decision to discontinue immunotherapy. I have discussed this at length with [redacted name] and his family. We have arranged urgent MRI spine and referral to clinical oncology for consideration of emergency radiotherapy to T12. I have also referred to the palliative care team for specialist input with symptom management.\n\nThe plan is for:\n1. Urgent MRI spine tomorrow\n2. Emergency radiotherapy assessment\n3. Palliative care review this week\n4. Consider paracentesis if symptoms worsen\n5. Review in one week with repeat bloods including liver function tests\n\nI have provided emergency contact numbers and educated about red flag symptoms requiring immediate medical attention.",
