She has managed the previous cycle well with only grade 1 hand-foot syndrome and mild fatigue. No significant neuropathy reported. Blood tests show stable parameters suitable for continuing treatment. CT scan performed last week shows no evidence of recurrent disease. She continues to gain weight gradually and has now returned to work part-time. The plan is to proceed with cycle 4 CAPOX today as scheduled. We will arrange follow-up CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after completion of planned 6 cycles. Next review in 3 weeks prior to cycle 5.",
