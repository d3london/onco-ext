She has completed her first cycle of dose-dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide on 15/3/24. The inflammatory changes in her right breast have shown early improvement with reduced erythema and induration. The initial presenting symptoms of breast warmth and heaviness have significantly improved. Performance status remains 1.\n\nOn examination, there is reduced erythema of the right breast compared to initial presentation. The skin thickening and peau d'orange appearance persist but are improved. The 4cm palpable mass at 2 o'clock position remains unchanged. No suspicious axillary lymphadenopathy.\n\nBlood results are satisfactory for proceeding with cycle 2. She has experienced grade 1 nausea and fatigue but otherwise tolerated treatment well. Plan to continue with cycle 2 today as scheduled. Will review again in 2 weeks prior to cycle 3.",
