The operation was uncomplicated and he has made an excellent recovery. His wound has healed well with no evidence of infection. His liver function tests have normalized and most recent AFP is within normal range at 4.2 ng/mL (previously elevated at 120 ng/mL pre-operatively). He reports good energy levels and has returned to gentle exercise. His appetite is improving and weight is stable at 82kg.\n\nOn examination today, his wound is well-healed and abdomen is soft and non-tender. There is no evidence of ascites. Performance status is 0.\n\nThe plan is for 3-monthly surveillance with alternating CT chest/abdomen/pelvis and liver MRI, along with regular AFP monitoring. First surveillance scan will be arranged for June 2024. We will review him again following these investigations.",
