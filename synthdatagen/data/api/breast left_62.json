  "content": "Diagnosis:\tLeft breast clear cell carcinoma, T1bN0M0, diagnosed March 2024\n\nER/PR negative, HER2 2+ (awaiting FISH), AKT mutation positive\n\nCT staging 15 March 2024 - no evidence of metastatic disease\n\nBone scan 18 March 2024 - normal\n\n[redacted name] is a 45-year-old lady who presented with a screen-detected left breast lesion. Core biopsy on 10/3/24 confirmed clear cell carcinoma. Staging investigations show no evidence of metastatic disease.\n\nIn her past medical history, she has well-controlled asthma on regular inhalers and migraine. She takes salbutamol and beclomethasone inhalers, and sumatriptan as required.\n\nOn examination today, there is a small palpable mass in the left breast at 2 o'clock position, approximately 1.2cm in size. No skin changes or nipple retraction. No palpable axillary nodes. Normal right breast examination.\n\nI have discussed her case at the breast MDT today. Given the unusual histology and biomarker profile, we recommend primary surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy, followed by consideration of adjuvant systemic therapy based on final pathology and HER2 FISH result.\n\nI have arranged pre-operative assessment for next week and she will be listed for surgery in early April. We will review her again with final pathology results to discuss adjuvant treatment options. She has been given contact details for our breast care nurse specialist.",
