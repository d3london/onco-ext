  "content": "Diagnosis:\nT2bN1M0 squamous cell carcinoma of left lower lobe lung\n\nPrevious treatment:\nCompleted 4 cycles carboplatin/gemcitabine March-May 2024\nPartial response achieved on CT 1 June 2024\n\nCurrent medications:\nDexamethasone 4mg bd\nAprepitant\nMetoclopramide prn\n\nCurrent situation:\nSeen following completion of chemotherapy with recent CT showing good partial response. Performance status remains 1.\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of 4 cycles of carboplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy. The recent CT scan from 1st June shows an excellent partial response with the primary mass reducing from 4.8cm to 2.1cm, and near complete resolution of hilar lymphadenopathy. His cough has significantly improved and he has regained 3kg of weight.\n\nHe has experienced grade 2 fatigue and grade 1 nausea during chemotherapy but overall tolerated treatment well. His most recent blood tests show stable renal function and acceptable haematological parameters.\n\nGiven his high PD-L1 expression (95%) and good performance status, we discussed transitioning to maintenance immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. I have explained the rationale, procedure, and potential side effects including immune-related adverse events. [redacted name] understands the monitoring requirements and has been given written information about immunotherapy.\n\nPlan:\nTo commence pembrolizumab 200mg every 3 weeks\nBaseline thyroid function, cortisol, and chest x-ray arranged\nReview in 3 weeks with blood tests prior\nCT scan after 4 cycles of immunotherapy",
