  "content": "Many thanks for referring [redacted name] who I met today following his recent diagnosis of esophageal cancer. He presented initially to his GP in January 2024 with progressive dysphagia to solids and weight loss of 4kg over 2 months. Upper GI endoscopy on 15th February 2024 identified a 3cm lesion in the lower esophagus, with biopsies confirming moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Subsequent staging investigations including CT chest/abdomen/pelvis and PET-CT completed on March 1st 2024 showed the primary tumor with no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastases. An endoscopic ultrasound on March 10th confirmed T2 disease. Molecular analysis has shown the tumor to be HER2 positive with FGFR2 amplification.\n\nI'm pleased to report that [redacted name] has maintained good functional status throughout his investigations, currently ECOG PS 0. His main symptom remains dysphagia to solids, though he can manage a soft diet and maintains adequate fluid intake. His weight has stabilized at 78kg (from previous 82kg) with dietary modifications and nutritional supplements. He describes occasional reflux symptoms well controlled with omeprazole. He has no chest pain or other concerning symptoms.\n\nIn his past medical history, he has well-controlled hypertension on amlodipine and mild osteoarthritis of both knees. He lives with his wife who provides excellent support, and they have two adult children living nearby. He is an ex-smoker having quit 15 years ago and drinks minimal alcohol.\n\nOn examination today, he appears well with normal vital signs. Cardiorespiratory examination is unremarkable. Abdominal examination reveals no masses or organomegaly. There is no peripheral lymphadenopathy.\n\nI have had a detailed discussion with [redacted name] and his wife about treatment options. Given his stage T2N0M0 disease and excellent performance status, I have recommended perioperative chemotherapy with FLOT regimen (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel) followed by surgery. The planned approach would be 4 cycles pre-operatively and 4 cycles post-operatively. I have explained the potential benefits in terms of disease-free and overall survival, as well as common side effects including nausea, fatigue, neuropathy, and risk of neutropenic sepsis.\n\nWe plan to commence treatment next week, with PICC line insertion scheduled for Monday. I have arranged weekly reviews during chemotherapy and provided emergency contact details. We will assess response with repeat CT after 4 cycles, prior to surgical referral. I have also referred [redacted name] to our dietitian for ongoing support during treatment.",
