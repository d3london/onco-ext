  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMetastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer with PALB2 mutation\n\nManagement:\tJan 2024 - Started Docetaxel chemotherapy\n\t\tMarch 2024 - Completed 6 cycles\n\t\tApril 2024 - Started Olaparib\n\nCurrent Situation:\tProgressive disease with rising PSA and new liver lesions\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following his recent CT scan. Unfortunately, this shows progression of disease with enlarging liver metastases and two new lesions in segment 7. His PSA has risen from 650 to 892 over the past 4 weeks despite starting Olaparib. His bone pain has significantly worsened, particularly in the thoracic spine and left hip, now requiring regular breakthrough oxycodone. His performance status has deteriorated to ECOG 2-3.\n\nOn examination, there is tender hepatomegaly extending 4cm below the costal margin. He has new peripheral edema to mid-calves bilaterally. Blood tests show deteriorating liver function with ALP 456 and ALT 234.\n\nI have discussed these findings with [redacted name] and his son. Given the rapid progression and declining performance status, I have recommended discontinuing Olaparib and transitioning to best supportive care. I have made an urgent referral to the palliative care team and prescribed additional analgesia. We have arranged weekly community nurse reviews and I will see him again in 2 weeks with repeat blood tests.\n\nI have also requested an urgent MRI spine to assess for cord compression risk given his increasing thoracic pain.",
