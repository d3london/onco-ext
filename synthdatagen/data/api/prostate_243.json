  "content": "Diagnosis:\t\tProstate cancer - T2c basaloid carcinoma\n\nManagement:\t\tCommenced LHRH analogue therapy March 2024\n\t\tRadical radiotherapy planned\n\nHistology:\t\tBasaloid carcinoma, Gleason 4+4=8\n\t\tBasal marker positive\n\nCurrent situation:\tPre-radiotherapy review\n\n[redacted name] has completed 3 months of LHRH analogue therapy with good biochemical response. His initial PSA of 9.2 has fallen to 0.8, and testosterone is adequately suppressed at 0.4 nmol/L. He reports minimal side effects from hormonal therapy apart from occasional hot flushes which are manageable without intervention. His urinary symptoms have improved significantly since starting treatment.\n\nI have discussed the radiotherapy treatment plan in detail today. He will commence radical radiotherapy to the prostate (74Gy in 37 fractions) next week. We have covered potential side effects and management strategies. His LHRH analogue therapy will continue throughout radiotherapy and for 2 years in total.\n\nWe will review him during week 1 of radiotherapy and then weekly throughout treatment. Follow-up will be arranged for 6 weeks post completion of radiotherapy.",
