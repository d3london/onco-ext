  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMetastatic pancreatic VIPoma\n\nManagement:\t2023 Oct - Commenced Lanreotide 120mg q4weekly\n\t\t2023 Nov - Started Capecitabine/Temozolomide\n\t\t2024 Jan - Dose reduction Capecitabine due to PPE\n\nHistology:\tWell-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (Ki67 12%)\n\t\tVIP 150 pmol/L at diagnosis\n\nCurrent Situation:\tProgression assessment post 6 cycles CAPTEM\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of 6 cycles of dose-modified CAPTEM. Recent CT shows stable disease in primary pancreatic mass (4.2cm) and liver metastases, but new small volume peritoneal disease. VIP levels have increased from 80 to 120 pmol/L over 8 weeks despite ongoing Lanreotide. Diarrhea has worsened requiring increased loperamide.\n\nOn examination, patient remains PS 1 with mild peripheral edema. Blood tests show stable biochemistry with potassium 3.4, maintaining good renal function.\n\nGiven evidence of clinical and biochemical progression, we have discussed changing treatment to PRRT. I have explained the rationale, procedure and potential side effects of Lu-177 DOTATATE. Recent Ga68 DOTATATE PET confirms good somatostatin receptor expression (Krenning score 4).\n\nPlan is to continue Lanreotide, discontinue CAPTEM, and proceed with PRRT assessment. Will need baseline renal function, FBC, and cardiac echo. Follow up in 2 weeks with results.",
