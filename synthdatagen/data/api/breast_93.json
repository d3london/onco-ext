CT 12/6/24 shows new liver lesions with largest measuring 4.2cm (previously 2.8cm) and progression in bone metastases with new T4 vertebral body involvement. Performance status has declined to ECOG 3, with increasing liver pain requiring opioid escalation and new onset confusion. LFTs show rising pattern with bilirubin now 42. Given rapid progression and declining performance status, we have discussed transition to best supportive care. I have made urgent referral to palliative care team and arranged admission for symptom control. We will discontinue systemic anti-cancer therapy. Family are fully aware of situation and prognosis discussed sensitively.",
