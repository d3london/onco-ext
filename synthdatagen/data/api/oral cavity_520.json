He has completed 2 cycles of concurrent cisplatin with acceptable renal function. Grade 2 mucositis is present requiring increased analgesia and nutritional supplements. Weight has dropped by 4kg to 72kg but remains above trigger for feeding tube insertion. Some improvement in right-sided oral pain noted following recent analgesia adjustment.\n\nExamination shows expected radiation-induced changes to right floor of mouth and neck. No evidence of disease progression. Performance status remains 1.\n\nPlan is to proceed with cycle 3 cisplatin next week pending blood results. Will continue daily radiotherapy. Dietitian review arranged for additional nutritional support. Follow-up in radiotherapy review clinic next week.",
