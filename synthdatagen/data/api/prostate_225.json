  "content": "Diagnosis:\tProstate adenocarcinoma, T2aN0M0\n\nManagement:\tInitial diagnosis via TRUS biopsy 15 March 2024\n\nHistology:\tGleason 3+4=7 (Grade Group 2) adenocarcinoma involving 4/12 cores, maximum 60% involvement\n\nBiomarkers:\tPSA at diagnosis 12.4 ng/mL, p53 negative\n\nCurrent Situation:\tNew diagnosis assessment\n\n[redacted name] is a 64-year-old gentleman referred following recent diagnosis of prostate cancer. His initial PSA was 12.4 ng/mL, leading to TRUS biopsy which confirmed Gleason 3+4 disease. MRI prostate shows a 1.4cm lesion in the right peripheral zone (PI-RADS 4) with no evidence of extraprostatic extension. Staging CT and bone scan show no evidence of metastatic disease.\n\nHe remains clinically well with good performance status. He reports mild lower urinary tract symptoms with occasional nocturia but no urinary retention. No bone pain or other symptoms of note. His past medical history includes well-controlled hypertension on amlodipine.\n\nI have discussed treatment options including radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy. He expresses a preference for surgical management. I have referred him to our robotic surgery team for further discussion. We will review him again once he has seen the surgical team to confirm management plan. His next PSA check will be in 6 weeks.",
