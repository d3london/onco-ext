The post-ablation scan shows complete ablation with no evidence of residual disease or metastatic uptake. Thyroglobulin remains undetectable and TSH is appropriately suppressed on current levothyroxine dose. The patient has recovered well from both surgery and RAI treatment with no ongoing side effects.\n\nPlan:\nContinue current levothyroxine dose\nThyroid function tests and thyroglobulin monitoring in 3 months\nFollow up appointment in 6 months with repeat neck ultrasound",
