  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMetastatic melanoma, T3bN2M1 (AJCC 8th edition), KIT mutation positive, BRAF wild type\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of cycle 2 imatinib. Unfortunately, the most recent CT scan performed on 15/4/24 shows clear evidence of disease progression with increase in size of all pulmonary metastases (largest lesion now 4.2cm from 2.8cm) and new right hilar lymphadenopathy. This is accompanied by deterioration in breathlessness, now occurring on minimal exertion, and persistent dry cough.\n\nIn view of clear clinical and radiological progression on imatinib, we have discussed alternative treatment options. Given previous pembrolizumab discontinuation due to grade 3 colitis in January 2024, and subsequent disease progression on imatinib, I have recommended commencing combination ipilimumab/nivolumab immunotherapy. I have explained the rationale, schedule, and potential side effects in detail, particularly the increased risk of immune-related toxicity compared to single agent treatment.\n\nPerformance status remains 2, with increasing fatigue and breathlessness limiting daily activities. Blood tests show stable parameters with normal LDH. We will proceed with cycle 1 ipilimumab/nivolumab next week following completion of consent. I have arranged CT assessment after 4 cycles and will review in 3 weeks with blood tests.",
