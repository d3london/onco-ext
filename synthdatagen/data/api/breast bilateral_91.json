She was diagnosed following screening mammogram which identified suspicious lesions in both breasts. Core biopsies confirmed triple negative disease with signet ring features in both breasts, with right axillary nodal involvement confirmed on ultrasound-guided biopsy.\n\nShe commenced dose-dense AC chemotherapy on 15/4/24 and has now completed 3 cycles. The treatment has been challenging but she has shown remarkable resilience. She experienced significant nausea during cycle 1 requiring adjustment to her antiemetic regimen with the addition of NK1 antagonist. This provided better control for cycles 2 and 3. She developed grade 2 fatigue which has been managed with appropriate rest periods and gentle exercise as tolerated.\n\nClinically there has been an excellent response to treatment with reduction in the palpable masses in both breasts. The right breast mass has decreased from 3.5cm to approximately 1.8cm, and the left from 2.8cm to 1.2cm on clinical measurement. The right axillary node is no longer palpable.\n\nHer blood counts have remained stable throughout treatment with nadir neutrophils consistently above 1.0. She has maintained good oral intake despite the nausea and her weight has remained stable at 68kg.\n\nWe have discussed the next phase of treatment. She will proceed with weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks with pembrolizumab, given her high PDL1 expression (95%). I have explained the different side effect profile of this combination, particularly the immune-related adverse events that we need to monitor carefully.\n\nThe plan is to commence paclitaxel/pembrolizumab next week, following repeat blood tests and baseline thyroid function. She will then be reviewed weekly during treatment. Breast MRI is booked for week 9 of paclitaxel to assess response, and surgical planning will follow completion of neoadjuvant therapy.\n\nShe remains positive about her treatment journey despite the challenges faced so far. Her husband continues to provide excellent support, and she has been utilizing our psychology support services which she finds beneficial.",
