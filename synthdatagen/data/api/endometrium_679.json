She reports no current symptoms of concern. Her wound sites have healed well. Performance status is 0. Examination today shows no concerning features.\n\nGiven the high-risk features (Grade 3, POLε mutation) but early stage disease, we have discussed the role of adjuvant treatment. The evidence suggests good prognosis with surgery alone in this molecular subtype. We will therefore proceed with surveillance rather than adjuvant therapy.\n\nPlan for 3-monthly follow up with alternate CT imaging. First surveillance CT chest/abdomen/pelvis arranged for June 2024. She understands to contact us sooner if any new symptoms develop.",
