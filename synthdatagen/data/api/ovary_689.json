She has tolerated the first two cycles well with only grade 1 nausea and mild fatigue. Blood counts and biochemistry are satisfactory for proceeding with treatment. No evidence of ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity. Performance status remains 0.\n\nCT scan performed last week shows no evidence of residual or metastatic disease. Tumor markers remain normal with inhibin B now within reference range at 28 pg/mL.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 3 BEP today. We will arrange final CT scan after completion of cycle 4. Follow-up appointment will be scheduled for 3 weeks' time.",
