Performance status remains 1. Weight has stabilized at 72kg. Appetite improving with pancreatic enzyme replacement. Liver function tests remain within normal range. Phosphate 0.82 maintained with supplementation. No ocular toxicity. The plan is to continue with cycle 3 today at full dose. Next CT scan due after cycle 4. Follow up arranged in 3 weeks with blood tests including phosphate monitoring.",
