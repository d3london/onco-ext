Stable disease confirmed on protocol-mandated imaging. Main symptoms are fatigue and mild peripheral neuropathy affecting fingertips only. Performance status maintained at ECOG 1. Blood results show adequate renal function with eGFR 68, normal liver function, and adequate haematological parameters for treatment. Trial-specific quality of life questionnaires completed. Protocol-mandated ECG shows no changes.\n\nPlan:\nProceed with cycle 4 trial treatment today\nContinue GCSF prophylaxis\nProtocol-mandated CT scan after cycle 6\nTrial follow-up visit in 3 weeks",
