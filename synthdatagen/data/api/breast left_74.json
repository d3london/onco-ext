The previous cycle was complicated by grade 2 neutropenia requiring a 1-week delay, though she has now recovered with neutrophils 1.8. She reports ongoing grade 1 peripheral neuropathy affecting fingertips only, and grade 1 fatigue that improves by day 10 of each cycle. No significant nausea with current antiemetic regime. Performance status remains 0.\n\nHER2 FISH testing results are pending and will guide addition of targeted therapy. Bloods today show adequate parameters for treatment. The plan is to proceed with cycle 4 FEC at full dose with enhanced GCSF support. We will review again in 3 weeks for final FEC cycle, then transition to docetaxel pending satisfactory recovery.",
