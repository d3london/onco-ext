  "content": "Diagnosis:\tLower third esophageal adenocarcinoma\n\nManagement:\t15 Apr 2024 Endoscopic ultrasound and biopsy\n\nHistology:\tModerately differentiated adenocarcinoma, HER2 negative, PDL1 CPS 8\n\nStaging:\t\tT3N0M0 (Stage IIB) on PET-CT 20 Apr 2024\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of his staging investigations. He initially presented with progressive dysphagia to solids over 3 months and 5kg weight loss. Endoscopy showed a 4cm circumferential lesion at 35-39cm. PET-CT confirms a locally advanced lower esophageal tumor with no nodal or distant metastatic disease.\n\nHe remains able to manage a soft diet with nutritional supplements. His weight has stabilized at 72kg and his performance status is 1. On examination today, there were no concerning features beyond mild epigastric tenderness.\n\nI have discussed his case at our Upper GI MDT. The consensus recommendation is for neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FLOT regimen (4 cycles) followed by surgery. I have explained the treatment plan, including common and serious side effects of chemotherapy. He will require a staging laparoscopy prior to commencing treatment, which I have arranged for next week.\n\nWe plan to commence chemotherapy in 2 weeks following insertion of a PICC line. He will be reviewed weekly during treatment by our specialist nurses with formal medical review prior to each cycle.",
