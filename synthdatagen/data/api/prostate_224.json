Metastatic prostate adenosquamous carcinoma with leptomeningeal and bone metastases\n\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\tNone\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\t15 Mar 2024 - Completed whole brain radiotherapy 20Gy in 5 fractions\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tCarboplatin/Etoposide from 01 Feb 2024 - discontinued after 2 cycles due to clinical deterioration\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tPhase II trial of Pembrolizumab in rare prostate cancer variants - commenced 01 Apr 2024\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease with worsening neurological symptoms\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tHeadaches, confusion, right-sided weakness\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tReviewed today for trial assessment. Performance status has deteriorated to ECOG 3. Experiencing grade 3 immune-related hepatitis with ALT 450, AST 380. MRI brain shows progressive leptomeningeal disease despite recent WBRT. CSF cytology positive for malignant cells. Latest PSA risen to 12.4 from 3.2 at baseline.\n\nNeurological symptoms have significantly worsened with increased confusion, persistent headaches, and new right-sided weakness grade 3/5. Now requiring wheelchair for mobility and increased care support at home.\n\nTrial discontinuation criteria met due to both clinical deterioration and grade 3 immune-related toxicity. Decision made to withdraw from trial after discussion with patient and family.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tUrgent CT chest/abdomen/pelvis to assess extent of progression\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tDexamethasone 4mg BD\nPrednisolone 60mg daily for immune-related hepatitis\n\n\tFollow up\n\tUrgent referral to palliative care team\nReview in general oncology clinic in 1 week\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tDaily district nurse visits for support\nMonitor LFTs twice weekly\nUrgent consideration for hospice referral",
