She has made an excellent recovery from surgery with good wound healing. The final histology confirms a 12mm adenomyoepithelioma with malignant features, grade 2, with clear margins and no lymph node involvement. Her hormone receptor status is strongly positive and HER2 negative. Following discussion at the breast MDT on 29 Jan 2024, the recommendation is for adjuvant endocrine therapy alone given the low-risk features. We have prescribed tamoxifen 20mg daily for 5 years, which she will start next week. She understands the common side effects and the importance of reporting any new symptoms. She will be enrolled in our standard follow-up program with annual mammography. Her next clinic review will be in 6 months' time.",
