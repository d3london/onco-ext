She has recovered well from her surgery with good wound healing and minimal residual pain. Her performance status is 0 and she remains physically active. Blood results show normal renal function with creatinine clearance 85ml/min, normal liver function, and adequate bone marrow reserve with hemoglobin 118g/L, neutrophils 3.8, platelets 285.\n\nI have discussed adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin AUC5 and paclitaxel 175mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. We reviewed common and serious side effects, and I have provided written information. She understands to contact us with any concerns. I have prescribed cycle 1 to commence next week and arranged follow-up prior to cycle 2.",
