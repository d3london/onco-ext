  "content": "I reviewed [redacted name] today in the breast oncology follow-up clinic. She is now 8 months post completion of adjuvant chemotherapy for her grade 2 papillary invasive breast cancer, originally diagnosed in June 2023. The initial staging was T2N1M0 with one positive sentinel node. Her tumor was ER positive (7/8), PR positive (6/8) with equivocal HER2 status (2+ on IHC, FISH negative). She completed 6 cycles of FEC chemotherapy in August 2023, followed by breast radiotherapy which completed in October 2023.\n\nShe is tolerating adjuvant tamoxifen well with only mild hot flushes. Her energy levels have improved significantly since completing chemotherapy and she has returned to work full-time as a teacher. She reports no new breast symptoms and no bone pain. Recent mammogram on 15 March 2024 shows post-treatment changes only with no evidence of recurrence. Blood tests including liver function are satisfactory.\n\nThe plan is to continue current management with tamoxifen. She will have annual mammogram surveillance and clinical review in 6 months' time. I have provided written information about potential side effects of tamoxifen and advised to contact the breast care nurse if she develops any new concerning symptoms.",
