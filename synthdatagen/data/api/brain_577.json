His back pain has completely resolved and leg strength is improving with physiotherapy support. He remains on a gradually reducing course of dexamethasone. Neurological examination shows improving power in both lower limbs (4+/5 proximally and distally) with normal sensation and reflexes.\n\nThe plan following MDT discussion is for MRI surveillance rather than adjuvant radiotherapy given the complete resection and WHO grade I histology. I have arranged MRI spine in 3 months' time and will review him in clinic with the results. He has been given contact details for the neuro-oncology clinical nurse specialist and understands to contact us if any new symptoms develop.",
