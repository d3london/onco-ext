  "content": "Diagnosis:\tSpindle cell carcinoma of right lung apex with chest wall invasion\n\nStaging:\tT3N1M0 at diagnosis January 2024\n\tPD-L1 60%, SMA positive\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today for assessment during cycle 3 of pembrolizumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel combination therapy. The initial chest wall pain has significantly improved following radiotherapy (30Gy in 10 fractions) completed on 15/3/24. His exercise tolerance has improved and he can now manage one flight of stairs without stopping. Performance status has improved to 1 from initial PS 2.\n\nCT chest performed last week shows encouraging 40% reduction in the primary mass with resolution of associated atelectasis. The previously noted right hilar node has reduced from 22mm to 12mm. No new sites of disease identified.\n\nBlood results show stable renal function and acceptable haematological parameters for cycle 3. Mild treatment-related fatigue persists but has not worsened. The previous grade 2 peripheral neuropathy has improved to grade 1 following the 20% paclitaxel dose reduction implemented at cycle 2.\n\nHe will proceed with cycle 3 today at current doses. I have arranged CT chest/abdomen/pelvis prior to cycle 4 to formally assess response. Review in 3 weeks with results.",
