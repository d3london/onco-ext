Left breast adenosquamous carcinoma, N0M0\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tMarch 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tCurative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Mar 2024 Core biopsy left breast\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tNot yet commenced\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tNot yet commenced\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tNewly diagnosed, awaiting definitive surgery\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tNone significant\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\t[redacted name] is a 52-year-old lady who attended breast clinic today following detection of a left breast mass on screening mammogram. Core biopsy has confirmed a low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma. Staging investigations including CT thorax/abdomen/pelvis and bone scan show no evidence of metastatic disease. Biomarker testing shows ER positive (8/8), PR positive (7/8), and HER2 positive (3+). NTRK fusion testing is negative.\n\nOn examination today, there is a 2.2cm firm mass in the left breast at 2 o'clock position, 4cm from nipple. No skin changes or nipple retraction. No palpable axillary nodes. Right breast normal.\n\nI have discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with [redacted name]. Given the tumor size and biomarker status, we recommend breast conserving surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and targeted anti-HER2 therapy, then radiotherapy.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tMRI breast for surgical planning\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tNone\n\n\tFollow up\n\tBreast MDT discussion next week\nSurgical consultation to be arranged within 2 weeks\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tNone",
