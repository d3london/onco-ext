The diagnosis is a HER2 positive adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, stage T2N1M0. He describes mild dysphagia to solids only, with some improvement since starting omeprazole. His weight has stabilized over the past month.\n\nOn examination, he is well-appearing with normal cardiorespiratory examination. Blood results show stable renal function and normal liver function tests.\n\nI have discussed the role of perioperative chemotherapy with the addition of trastuzumab given the HER2 positive status. The plan is for 3 cycles of FLOT chemotherapy with trastuzumab, followed by restaging and surgery, then 3 further cycles post-operatively. I have arranged for PICC line insertion next week and chemotherapy to start the following week. He will be reviewed prior to each cycle.",
