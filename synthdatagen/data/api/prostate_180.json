Initial PSA 42.1 ng/mL in January 2024. MRI showed T3b disease with right seminal vesicle invasion and suspicious right external iliac nodes. Bone scan negative. Patient completed radical radiotherapy 2 weeks ago with good tolerance. Latest PSA 0.8 ng/mL showing good biochemical response.\n\nMDT recommendations:\n1. Continue androgen deprivation therapy for total of 24 months\n2. PSA monitoring every 3 months\n3. Consider calcium/vitamin D supplementation given duration of planned ADT\n\nExamination today shows good performance status. Digital rectal examination reveals reduction in prostatic induration compared to diagnosis.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tPSA monitoring as above\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tCalcium/Vitamin D supplements initiated\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up in 3 months with PSA check one week prior\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPlease monitor renal function and bone profile in view of ongoing ADT",
