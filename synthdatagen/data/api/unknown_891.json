  "content": "Diagnosis\n\t1. Metastatic poorly cohesive carcinoma of unknown primary origin\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2024 Diagnostic pleural biopsy\n\n\tSystemic therapy\n\t1. First-line carboplatin/etoposide - 2 cycles Jan-Feb 2024\n\t2. Second-line Lu-177-DOTATATE - cycle 1 commenced March 2024\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease with deteriorating clinical status\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Worsening bone pain\n\t2. Progressive dyspnoea\n\t3. Declining performance status\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tI reviewed [redacted name] today, who attended with his wife. Unfortunately, he has experienced significant clinical deterioration over the past three weeks. His performance status has declined from ECOG 1 to ECOG 3, now spending approximately 70% of the day in bed or resting. His bone pain has escalated despite increasing oral morphine to 60mg BD MST, with particularly troublesome pain in the thoracic spine and right hip. His oxygen requirements have increased from 2L to 4L/min at rest.\n\nThe recent CT scan (15/4/24) shows progressive pleural disease with increasing nodularity and moderate right pleural effusion. There are also new bone metastases in T4, T7, and right acetabulum. His latest bloods show deteriorating renal function with eGFR now 38 (previously 52) and rising inflammatory markers.\n\nGiven his declining performance status and organ function, we have agreed to discontinue Lu-177-DOTATATE therapy after the single cycle. I have had a detailed discussion with [redacted name] and his wife about focusing on symptom control and quality of life. They understand and accept this change in treatment approach.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tUrgent MRI spine to assess for cord compression risk\n\n\tMedication changes\n\t1. Increased MST to 90mg BD\n\t2. Added pregabalin 75mg BD\n\t3. Commenced dexamethasone 4mg BD\n\n\tFollow up\n\t1. Urgent palliative care review arranged for tomorrow\n\t2. Radiotherapy assessment next week for bone pain\n\t3. Community palliative care team referral completed\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\t1. Please monitor renal function weekly\n\t2. Consider increasing package of care given declining mobility\n\t3. DS1500 completed today",
