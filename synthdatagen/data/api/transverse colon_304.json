The procedure was uncomplicated and he has recovered well with no ongoing symptoms. His bowel function has returned to normal and he reports good appetite and stable weight.\n\nOn examination, he is well with normal vital signs. Abdomen is soft and non-tender with well-healed port sites. No concerning clinical findings.\n\nI have reviewed the histology which confirms pTis disease with complete excision and clear margins. Given the early stage, no adjuvant treatment is required. We have discussed surveillance strategy including repeat colonoscopy in 12 months. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis has been arranged for baseline staging.\n\nPlan is for clinical review in 3 months with CT results. [redacted name] understands to contact us sooner if any new symptoms develop.",
