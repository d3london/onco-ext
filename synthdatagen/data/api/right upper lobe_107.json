She has completed concurrent chemoradiotherapy 6 weeks ago with good tolerance. Her radiation pneumonitis has now resolved and she reports improved energy levels. Her initial dyspnoea has significantly improved. Performance status remains 1. Recent CT chest shows good partial response with >50% reduction in primary tumor size. Blood tests show stable renal function and normal FBC. The plan is to commence maintenance durvalumab immunotherapy next week as per protocol. We will arrange CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after 3 cycles. Review in 4 weeks with blood tests.",
