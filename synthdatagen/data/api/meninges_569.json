Steroid-induced diabetes\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2023 - Subtotal resection of right frontal meningioma\n\t12 May 2023 - Second debulking procedure for local recurrence\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\t1. March 2023 - Post-operative radiotherapy 60Gy in 30 fractions\n\t2. August 2023 - Palliative radiotherapy to T4-T6 metastases 20Gy in 5 fractions\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tBevacizumab commenced September 2023, discontinued December 2023 due to disease progression\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNot eligible\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive intracranial and extracranial disease\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Increasing headaches and confusion\n\t2. Progressive thoracic spine pain\n\t3. Right-sided weakness\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\t[redacted name] attended today's clinic with his wife and daughter. Unfortunately, his condition has deteriorated significantly over the past three weeks. His headaches have worsened despite increasing dexamethasone to 8mg twice daily. He is experiencing intermittent confusion and his right-sided weakness has progressed, now requiring a wheelchair for mobility. His performance status has declined to ECOG 3.\n\nThe most recent MRI brain (15 March 2024) shows significant progression of intracranial disease with new satellite lesions and increasing mass effect. CT spine confirms progression of thoracic vertebral metastases with new T8 involvement. Blood tests show worsening renal function with eGFR 38.\n\nI have had a detailed discussion with [redacted name] and his family about disease progression and poor prognosis. We agreed to focus on symptom control and quality of life. I have explained that further systemic treatment is unlikely to be beneficial given his declining performance status.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tNone planned\n\n\tMedication changes\n\t1. Increased dexamethasone to 12mg daily in divided doses\n\t2. Added pregabalin 75mg twice daily for neuropathic pain\n\n\tFollow up\n\t1. Urgent referral to palliative care team\n\t2. Weekly review by neuro-oncology nurse specialist\n\t3. Next oncology review in 2 weeks or sooner if needed\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\t1. Please monitor steroid-induced diabetes\n\t2. Consider prophylactic antibiotics if neutrophils fall below 1.0\n\n\tSummary of information given to patient\n\tDiscussed disease progression and transition to palliative approach. Family aware of poor prognosis.",
