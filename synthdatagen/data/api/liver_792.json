Treatment continues to be well tolerated with only grade 1 fatigue. Performance status remains 0. Latest liver function tests are stable and within normal range. No new symptoms reported. The recent CT scan shows continued disease stability with no new concerning features. The plan is to continue with the current treatment regimen and arrange repeat imaging in 3 months. Will review again before cycle 13 in 3 weeks.",
