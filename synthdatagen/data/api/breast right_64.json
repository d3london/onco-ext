She is tolerating the adjuvant letrozole well with only mild arthralgias affecting her knees, which she manages with regular paracetamol. Her energy levels have improved since surgery and she has returned to her usual daily activities including regular swimming. The surgical site has healed well with an excellent cosmetic outcome. On examination today, there is no evidence of local recurrence, and the right axilla remains clear. Her weight is stable at 68kg.\n\nI have provided written information about managing hormone therapy side effects. We will continue with letrozole and arrange routine mammographic surveillance at one year. She will be reviewed again in the breast clinic in 6 months' time. Blood tests including liver function will be checked by her GP in 3 months.",
