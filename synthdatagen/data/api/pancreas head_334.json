He was diagnosed in January 2024 with locally advanced pancreatic cancer following investigation of obstructive jaundice. Initial CT demonstrated a 4.8cm mass in the pancreatic head with involvement of the superior mesenteric vessels and regional lymphadenopathy. Histology confirmed colloid variant adenocarcinoma.\n\nHe commenced FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy in February 2024 and has completed 4 cycles with stable disease on recent imaging. Treatment has been complicated by grade 2 peripheral neuropathy and fatigue, but he has maintained PS 2 throughout. His main symptoms are controlled with regular analgesia and pancreatic enzyme replacement.\n\nOn examination today, he is cachectic but not jaundiced. Abdomen is soft with mild epigastric tenderness but no palpable mass. Latest bloods show stable renal function, normal LFTs, and CEA trending down from >1000 to 850.\n\nThe plan is to continue FOLFIRINOX to complete 6 cycles, with CT reassessment after cycle 6. He requires weekly blood tests and clinical review every 3 weeks. I would be grateful if you could take over his ongoing care. Full imaging and pathology reports will follow separately.",
