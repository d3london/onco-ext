  "content": "Diagnosis:\nClear cell renal cell carcinoma, pT3bN1M1 with IVC thrombus and bilateral pulmonary metastases\n\nPrevious treatment:\nRight radical nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy 15 March 2024\nCompleted 2 cycles Ipilimumab/Nivolumab combination immunotherapy\n\nCurrent situation:\nProgressive disease with new pulmonary nodules and enlarging mediastinal lymphadenopathy\n\nMDT Discussion 25 April 2024:\nComprehensive review of imaging showing:\n- Multiple new bilateral pulmonary nodules, largest 2.1cm right upper lobe\n- Enlarging mediastinal lymphadenopathy, station 4R now measuring 3.2cm\n- No evidence of local recurrence\n- Brain MRI negative for metastases\n\nDiscussion points:\n1. Early progression during first-line immunotherapy\n2. Performance status deterioration from ECOG 1 to ECOG 2\n3. New onset cough and exertional dyspnoea\n4. Grade 2 immune-related hepatitis requiring prednisolone\n\nMDT Recommendations:\n1. Discontinue Ipilimumab/Nivolumab due to disease progression and toxicity\n2. Switch to Cabozantinib 60mg daily once liver function tests normalize\n3. Arrange urgent palliative radiotherapy assessment for symptomatic mediastinal disease\n4. Continue prednisolone taper as per immune-related toxicity protocol\n\nPlan:\n1. Review in clinic next week with repeat LFTs\n2. Proceed with Cabozantinib if ALT < 3x upper limit of normal\n3. Clinical oncology assessment for palliative radiotherapy\n4. Arrange CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after 8 weeks of Cabozantinib",
