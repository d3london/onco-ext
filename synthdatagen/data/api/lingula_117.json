  "content": "Diagnosis:\tSmall cell lung cancer (lingula) with widespread metastatic disease\n\nStage T4 N3 M1b - extensive stage disease with liver and bone metastases\n\nI am writing following today's Lung Cancer MDT discussion of [redacted name], a 67-year-old gentleman who was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer in January 2024. The initial staging showed a 7.2cm mass in the lingula with extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy, multiple liver metastases, and bone involvement including the thoracic spine and left femur.\n\nHe commenced first-line carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy on 25th January 2024 and has now completed 4 cycles. His most recent CT scan on 15th April 2024 shows an excellent partial response with approximately 70% reduction in the size of the primary mass, significant reduction in mediastinal nodes, and near-complete resolution of liver metastases. The bone metastases appear sclerotic, suggesting treatment response.\n\nHis clinical condition has improved significantly during treatment. His initial symptoms of breathlessness and bone pain have largely resolved, and his performance status has improved from ECOG 2 to ECOG 1. He has tolerated chemotherapy well with only grade 1 fatigue and manageable nausea.\n\nThe MDT recommendations are:\n1. Complete the planned 6 cycles of carboplatin/etoposide\n2. Proceed to prophylactic cranial irradiation given the good response to treatment\n3. Consider consolidation thoracic radiotherapy following completion of chemotherapy\n\nWe will see him next week to commence cycle 5 of chemotherapy and discuss the radiotherapy plans in detail. A repeat CT scan will be arranged after completion of all treatment to document the final response.\n\nHis case will be re-discussed at the MDT following completion of all therapy to determine the surveillance strategy.",
