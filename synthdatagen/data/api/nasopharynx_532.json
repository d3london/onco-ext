Nasopharyngeal carcinoma T3N2bM0\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tCurative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t15 Jan - 25 Feb 2024: 3 cycles TPF induction (Docetaxel/Cisplatin/5-FU)\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tNot yet commenced\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tPartial response to induction chemotherapy\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tGrade 3 peripheral neuropathy\nGrade 2 hearing loss\nPersistent grade 2 mucositis\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 45-year-old gentleman has completed 3 cycles of TPF induction chemotherapy for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. MRI 28/3/24 shows good partial response with >50% reduction in primary tumor volume and significant reduction in nodal disease. However, he has developed significant toxicity including grade 3 peripheral neuropathy affecting hands and feet, grade 2 hearing loss confirmed on audiometry, and persistent grade 2 mucositis.\n\nGiven the good disease response but concerning toxicity profile, we have discussed modifying the treatment plan. Rather than proceeding with concurrent chemoradiation with high-dose cisplatin as originally planned, we will proceed with radiotherapy alone followed by adjuvant immunotherapy. This decision takes into account his EBV positive status and high PDL1 expression (CPS 65).\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tRepeat audiometry prior to radiotherapy\nBaseline thyroid function\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tGabapentin 300mg TDS for neuropathy\n\n\tFollow up\n\tRadiotherapy planning appointment 15/4/24\nReview in combined clinic with clinical oncology 22/4/24\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly FBC, U&E monitoring during radiotherapy\nUrgent referral if grade 3-4 toxicity develops",
