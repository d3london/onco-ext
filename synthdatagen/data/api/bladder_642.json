Progressive fatigue - PS 3\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 67-year-old gentleman was diagnosed in January 2024 with mixed small cell carcinoma of bladder with extensive metastatic disease. Initial diagnostic TURBT confirmed small cell morphology with positive CD56 and Chromogranin A staining. Staging investigations revealed multiple liver metastases, bilateral pulmonary nodules, and widespread bone metastases including a symptomatic T7 lesion.\n\nHe initially responded well to first-line Carboplatin/Etoposide with partial response after 2 cycles, but developed progressive disease after cycle 4 with new liver lesions. Second-line Atezolizumab was commenced in April 2024 but discontinued after 2 cycles due to clear clinical and radiological progression with deteriorating liver function.\n\nHe has experienced significant clinical deterioration over the past 4 weeks with increasing fatigue, right upper quadrant pain, and new onset jaundice. His performance status has declined from 2 to 3. Recent CT shows progressive liver metastases with new ascites.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tWeekly LFTs\n\n\tMedication changes\n\t1. MST increased to 60mg BD\n\t2. Commenced Dexamethasone 4mg BD\n\n\tFollow up\n\tReferral made to local palliative care team\nTransfer of ongoing care to local oncology unit at [redacted name] Hospital\n\n\tRequired actions for receiving team\n\t1. Urgent palliative care review\n\t2. Consider third line chemotherapy options if performance status improves\n\t3. Weekly clinical review with LFTs\n\t4. Early involvement of community palliative care team",
