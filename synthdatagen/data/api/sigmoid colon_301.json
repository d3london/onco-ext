Histology reviewed by Dr [redacted name] confirming unusual adenosquamous variant. Given stage III disease with 2 positive lymph nodes, the consensus recommendation is for adjuvant CAPOX chemotherapy. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis performed on 8 April 2024 shows no evidence of metastatic disease. Patient has recovered well from surgery with PS 0 and normal CEA. Plan is to commence 6 months of adjuvant CAPOX chemotherapy. Will be seen in oncology clinic next week to discuss treatment. Surgical follow-up arranged for 3 months.",
