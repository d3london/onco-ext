She has tolerated the first three cycles well with only grade 1 fatigue and mild peripheral neuropathy affecting fingertips. Blood results show stable parameters with hemoglobin 115 g/L, neutrophils 2.8, platelets 245. CA125 has normalized from initial 85 to current 12. No clinical evidence of disease progression.\n\nPlan to proceed with cycle 4 today as scheduled. Will arrange CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after cycle 6 to confirm response. Follow-up appointment in 3 weeks for cycle 5.",
