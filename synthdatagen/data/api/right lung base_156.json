The case was presented with recent imaging showing encouraging partial response to immunotherapy combination treatment. The CT thorax from 5/3/24 demonstrates 40% reduction in the right lower lobe primary mass (now measuring 4.2cm from 7.0cm) and significant improvement in pleural disease with resolution of pleural effusion. No new sites of disease were identified.\n\nPerformance status remains 1. Recent blood tests show stable renal function and liver function tests within normal range. The patient reports improved exercise tolerance and resolution of previous chest pain.\n\nThe MDT recommendations are to continue with the current treatment regimen of Carboplatin AUC5, Pemetrexed 500mg/m2 and Pembrolizumab 200mg for a further 3 cycles, followed by maintenance Pembrolizumab. A repeat CT thorax/abdomen/pelvis is recommended after cycle 6. [redacted name] will be reviewed in clinic next week prior to cycle 4, with routine blood tests and toxicity assessment.",
