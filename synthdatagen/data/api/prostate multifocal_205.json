  "content": "I reviewed [redacted name] today in the uro-oncology clinic, accompanied by his wife and daughter. Unfortunately, his disease has shown significant progression despite recent intensification of systemic therapy.\n\nInitially diagnosed in January 2024 with metastatic prostate cancer, histology confirmed ductal adenocarcinoma with RAD51D mutation. His presenting PSA was 678. Staging investigations revealed T4 disease with extensive local invasion, pelvic lymphadenopathy, and widespread bone metastases particularly affecting the thoracic spine and pelvis.\n\nHe commenced androgen deprivation therapy with Goserelin and Enzalutamide in February 2024, with initial good biochemical response (PSA nadir 89). However, by April 2024, despite castrate testosterone levels, his PSA had risen to 234 with new onset back pain. MRI spine confirmed progression of bone metastases with new T8 vertebral body involvement and concerning cord compression risk.\n\nHe received emergency radiotherapy (20Gy in 5 fractions) to T7-9 in early April 2024, followed by commencement of docetaxel chemotherapy. Unfortunately, after two cycles, he developed grade 3 neutropenia requiring GCSF support and dose reduction. Despite these measures, his most recent PSA has risen further to 456 with deteriorating performance status.\n\nOn review today, his mobility has significantly declined (PS 3) and he requires wheelchair assistance. He describes severe bone pain requiring regular oxycodone, which was recently increased to 40mg BD. He has developed new onset right-sided sciatica and reports increasing fatigue and anorexia with 6kg weight loss over the past month.\n\nExamination reveals marked tenderness over the thoracic spine and right hip. Neurological examination shows new right L5/S1 radiculopathy with reduced power (4/5) in right ankle dorsiflexion. Recent blood tests show declining hemoglobin (98 g/L) and rising alkaline phosphatase (876 U/L).\n\nGiven his RAD51D mutation status and deteriorating clinical picture, I have discussed his case with the Phase I team. He may be eligible for the PARP inhibitor trial, pending screening. In the interim, we will arrange urgent MRI spine and pelvis to assess nerve root compression, refer to the acute pain team for review of analgesia, and organize blood transfusion support. I have also referred him to our palliative care colleagues for specialist input regarding symptom management.\n\nWe will see him again next week with imaging results and trial screening outcome. His wife and daughter understand the gravity of the situation and are supportive of the proposed plan.",
