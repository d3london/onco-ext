  "content": "Diagnosis:\nBilateral synchronous primary squamous cell carcinoma of lung\n\nRight lung: T3N1M0 squamous cell carcinoma, right upper lobe\nLeft lung: T2N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma, left lower lobe\n\nMolecular profile:\nRight lung primary - FGFR2-TACC3 fusion detected\nLeft lung primary - pending\n\nPrevious medical history:\nType 2 diabetes\nHypertension\nEx-smoker (stopped 2020, 40 pack years)\n\nCurrent medications:\nMetformin 1g BD\nRamipril 5mg OD\n\nAllergies:\nNone known\n\nCurrent situation:\n\nInitial presentation 15/3/24 with haemoptysis. CT thorax showed 4.8cm mass right upper lobe with ipsilateral hilar nodes and separate 2.2cm left lower lobe mass. PET-CT 28 March 2024 confirmed FDG-avid bilateral lung lesions without distant metastases. Bronchoscopic biopsies 5 April 2024 confirmed squamous cell carcinoma from both lesions.\n\nMolecular testing has identified actionable FGFR2 fusion in the right lung primary. Left-sided molecular results pending. MRI brain shows no metastases.\n\nOn examination today, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturations 96% on air. Reduced breath sounds right upper zone. No clubbing. No lymphadenopathy.\n\nDiscussed at Lung MDT 12/4/24. Recommendation for FGFR inhibitor therapy (Pemigatinib) to right-sided disease followed by assessment for possible surgery to left lung primary depending on response.\n\nI have explained the diagnosis and treatment plan. [redacted name] understands the complexity of managing synchronous primaries and the rationale for targeted therapy. We will commence Pemigatinib next week following baseline ophthalmology assessment and phosphate monitoring. Review arranged in 2 weeks with blood tests.",
