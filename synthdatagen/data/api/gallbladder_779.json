Gallbladder adenocarcinoma T4N2M1, MMR deficient\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2024 Diagnostic laparoscopy and biopsy only - unresectable disease\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t1. GEMCIS - 2 cycles Jan-Feb 2024\n\t2. Pembrolizumab monotherapy commenced March 2024\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease with deteriorating clinical status\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Progressive jaundice\n\t2. Increasing abdominal pain\n\t3. Marked weight loss\n\t4. Fatigue WHO PS 3\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who attended with her husband. Unfortunately, she has experienced significant clinical deterioration over the past three weeks. Her jaundice has deepened with bilirubin now at 285 μmol/L compared to 156 μmol/L three weeks ago. She reports worsening right upper quadrant and epigastric pain requiring increased opioid analgesia, and her appetite has significantly declined with 4kg further weight loss.\n\nCT imaging performed yesterday shows marked progression of disease with increasing size of the primary gallbladder mass now measuring 8.2cm (previously 6.5cm), new and enlarging peritoneal deposits, and progressive liver metastases with associated biliary obstruction. There are also new pulmonary nodules.\n\nShe has only managed two cycles of GEMCIS earlier this year with significant toxicity including grade 3 neutropenia requiring GCSF support. She commenced pembrolizumab in March 2024 given MMR deficient status but has unfortunately shown primary resistance with clear progression.\n\nOn examination today, she is markedly jaundiced with tender hepatomegaly and moderate ascites. Her performance status has declined to WHO PS 3, spending >50% of time in bed.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\t1. Urgent ERCP referral made today\n\t2. Ascitic tap for symptom relief to be arranged\n\n\tMedication changes\n\t1. Increased MST to 30mg BD\n\t2. Added metoclopramide 10mg TDS\n\n\tFollow up\n\t1. Urgent palliative care review arranged for tomorrow\n\t2. Discontinuing pembrolizumab given clear progression\n\t3. Will review next week after ERCP\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\t1. Please monitor renal function given deteriorating status\n\t2. District nurse referral made for support with increasing care needs",
