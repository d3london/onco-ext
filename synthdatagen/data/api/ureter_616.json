  "content": "Diagnosis:\tUrothelial carcinoma (plasmacytoid variant) of right ureter\n\nManagement:\t12 Jan 2024 Right nephroureterectomy\n\nHistology:\tpT2N1M0 plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma, PD-L1 TPS 90%\n\nCurrent Situation:\tCycle 3 adjuvant pembrolizumab\n\nI was very pleased to review [redacted name] in clinic today who is managing remarkably well with immunotherapy treatment. She continues to maintain an excellent attitude despite the challenges of regular hospital visits. Her energy levels have improved since our last review, and she has been able to resume her regular walking routine, managing 30 minutes daily without significant fatigue. She reports no new symptoms and specifically denies any immune-related side effects such as skin rashes, diarrhea, or breathing difficulties. Her appetite remains good and her weight is stable at 68kg.\n\nShe did experience a mild infusion reaction during cycle 2 with some facial flushing, but this resolved quickly with reduced infusion rate and has not recurred. Her blood tests today show stable renal function with creatinine 98 μmol/L, normal liver function, and appropriate thyroid function. Blood pressure today was 138/82.\n\nOn examination, her surgical wounds have healed well with no concerning features. Cardiorespiratory examination is normal and there is no peripheral edema or lymphadenopathy.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 4 of pembrolizumab today. We have provided written information about potential immune-related adverse events to watch for. She will have repeat blood tests including thyroid function before cycle 5. We will arrange a progress CT scan after cycle 4 to assess disease status. She will be reviewed again in clinic in 3 weeks time.",
