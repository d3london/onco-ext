She has shown great resilience in facing her diagnosis and maintaining a positive outlook. The surgical sites have healed excellently, and she reports good energy levels despite some initial fatigue with the immunotherapy. She experienced mild arthralgia after the first cycle which resolved spontaneously, and has developed a minor pruritic rash affecting her trunk which is well managed with E45 cream.\n\nOn examination today, there is no evidence of local recurrence or lymphadenopathy. The surgical sites remain well-healed. Her blood tests show stable liver function and thyroid function.\n\nWe had a detailed discussion about continuing immunotherapy. She understands the importance of reporting any new symptoms promptly, particularly those that might indicate immune-related adverse effects. She feels well supported by our melanoma nurse specialists and has been making good use of the emergency contact card.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 3 of nivolumab today. We will arrange CT chest/abdomen/pelvis prior to cycle 4, and thyroid function monitoring as per protocol. She will be reviewed again in clinic in 2 weeks with blood results.",
