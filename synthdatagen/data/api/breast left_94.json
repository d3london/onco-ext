She is tolerating treatment relatively well with only grade 1 fatigue and mild peripheral neuropathy affecting her fingertips. Her main concern is hair loss which is now complete, though she has adapted well to her wig. Performance status remains 0.\n\nOn examination there is good healing of the mastectomy site. No evidence of local recurrence. No palpable lymphadenopathy.\n\nBlood results show stable parameters with hemoglobin 110 g/L, neutrophils 2.8, platelets 245. Liver and renal function remain normal.\n\nHappy to proceed with cycle 4 TCHP at full dose today. Will review again in 3 weeks prior to cycle 5.",
