He has tolerated the treatment well with only grade 1 fatigue and occasional nausea well controlled with antiemetics. His surgical wounds have healed well and he is managing his ileal conduit independently. Performance status remains 0. Recent CT shows no evidence of disease recurrence. Blood tests show stable renal function with eGFR 65.\n\nThe plan is to arrange 3-monthly surveillance CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for the first year. He will be reviewed in clinic with scan results in 3 months' time. I have provided written information about signs and symptoms to watch for. He understands to contact us sooner if any concerns develop.",
