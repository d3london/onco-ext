Her cortisol levels remain well controlled with hydrocortisone replacement (10mg/5mg/5mg). Morning ACTH is 12 ng/L (previously 85 ng/L pre-surgery). Recent MRI pituitary (March 2024) shows no evidence of residual or recurrent disease. She reports good energy levels and has maintained stable weight at 65kg. Blood pressure today 128/82. Other pituitary axes remain intact with normal thyroid, gonadal and growth hormone function. Plan to continue current hydrocortisone regime and arrange routine follow-up MRI in 6 months.",
