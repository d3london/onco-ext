  "content": "I was pleased to review [redacted name] in follow-up clinic today following their right partial nephrectomy performed on 15 March 2024 for a stage I mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma of the kidney. The surgery was uncomplicated and histology confirmed a pT1bN0M0 tumor measuring 5.2cm, with negative margins. Immunohistochemistry showed CK7 positivity.\n\nThey have made an excellent recovery from surgery with complete wound healing and no ongoing pain. Their renal function remains stable with creatinine 98 and eGFR >60. Today's chest x-ray shows no evidence of metastatic disease. Blood pressure is well-controlled at 132/78.\n\nOn examination, the surgical site is well-healed with no concerning features. Performance status remains 0 and they have returned to normal activities including work.\n\nGiven the stage and complete resection, we have discussed that no adjuvant therapy is required. The plan is for continued surveillance with alternating CT and ultrasound every 6 months for the first 2 years. I have arranged CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for 3 months' time and will review them afterward.",
