WNT-activated medulloblastoma, M0 stage\n\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tMarch 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tCurative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Mar 2024 Complete surgical resection of posterior fossa mass\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tPlanned but not yet commenced\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tNot yet commenced\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tWNT-MB-04 trial registration completed today\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tPost-operative, no evidence of residual disease\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tMild post-operative cerebellar syndrome\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 8-year-old boy attended with his parents for trial registration following complete resection of a WNT-activated medulloblastoma. Post-operative MRI on 22/3/24 confirms complete resection with no evidence of dissemination. CSF cytology from 20/3/24 is negative for malignant cells. Molecular analysis confirms WNT-activation with nuclear beta-catenin positivity and CTNNB1 mutation.\n\nHe has made an excellent post-operative recovery with improving balance and coordination. Currently mobilising independently with mild ataxia. No cranial nerve deficits. Performance status is 1.\n\nWe have thoroughly discussed the WNT-MB-04 trial which is investigating reduced-intensity treatment in WNT-activated medulloblastoma. The family understands the rationale for de-escalation given the excellent prognosis of this molecular subgroup. We reviewed all eligibility criteria, which are met. Trial-specific assessments including audiometry, endocrine evaluation, and neuropsychology testing have been scheduled.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tBaseline trial assessments:\n\t- Pure tone audiometry 28/3/24\n\t- Endocrine assessment 29/3/24\n\t- Neuropsychology evaluation 1/4/24\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tDexamethasone weaning regime as per protocol\n\n\tFollow up\n\tTrial baseline visit scheduled for 3/4/24\nRadiotherapy planning appointment 5/4/24\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly FBC, U&E, LFT monitoring during radiotherapy phase\n\n\tSummary of information given to the patient\n\tFull trial information provided including treatment schedule, required assessments, and potential risks/benefits. Written information given regarding radiotherapy preparation.",
