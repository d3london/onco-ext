  "content": "Diagnosis:\tBasal cell carcinoma right temple, T3 with local invasion\n\nManagement:\t15 Mar 2024 Initial surgical excision with positive margins\n\t\t02 Apr 2024 Started radiotherapy\n\nCurrent Situation:\tWeek 3 of radiotherapy treatment\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today during radiotherapy treatment. The right temple surgical site shows expected radiation changes with moderate erythema and mild desquamation. There is no evidence of infection or bleeding. The patient reports mild local discomfort managed well with regular paracetamol. No systemic symptoms reported.\n\nThe radiotherapy team confirms good treatment compliance with 12 of 20 fractions completed. Treatment tolerance remains satisfactory with only grade 1 skin toxicity. The surgical site appears to be responding appropriately to treatment with reducing induration at the margins.\n\nPlan is to complete the remaining fractions as scheduled. Will review again in clinic 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy for wound assessment and consideration of follow-up imaging. Patient understands to contact if any concerns in the interim.",
