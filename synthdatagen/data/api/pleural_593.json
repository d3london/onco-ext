  "content": "Many thanks for referring [redacted name] who I met today accompanied by his wife and daughter. He is a 68-year-old retired construction worker who has unfortunately been diagnosed with sarcomatoid mesothelioma following investigation of progressive right-sided chest pain and breathlessness. The diagnosis was confirmed on thoracoscopic biopsy performed by [redacted name] on March 15th 2024, showing sarcomatoid mesothelioma with BAP1 loss and retained MTAP expression. Staging investigations including CT and PET-CT completed on March 25th 2024 demonstrate extensive right pleural disease with mediastinal lymph node involvement but no distant metastases, consistent with Stage III disease.\n\nHe describes a 4-month history of gradually worsening breathlessness, now getting short of breath after walking about 100 yards on the flat. He has experienced right-sided chest pain requiring regular co-codamol and more recently morphine sulfate liquid for breakthrough pain. His appetite has reduced somewhat though his weight has remained stable. He continues to maintain good mobility around the house but has had to give up his regular golf. His performance status is 1-2.\n\nIn terms of his background, he had significant asbestos exposure during his 35-year career in construction, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. He has well-controlled hypertension on amlodipine 5mg daily and takes simvastatin 40mg for hypercholesterolemia. He has never smoked and drinks minimal alcohol.\n\nOn examination today, he has reduced chest expansion and dullness to percussion over the right hemithorax with associated reduced breath sounds. There is no supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. His latest chest x-ray from April 1st 2024 shows stable right pleural thickening with a small effusion compared to previous imaging.\n\nI have had a lengthy discussion with [redacted name] and his family about management options. Given the sarcomatoid histology and Stage III disease, I have recommended combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed. We discussed the aims of treatment being to control the disease and improve symptoms while maintaining quality of life. I explained the common and serious side effects in detail, including risks of fatigue, nausea, kidney problems, and bone marrow suppression. He has good physiological reserve and I believe will tolerate the treatment well.\n\nWe have arranged baseline blood tests, kidney function testing, and audiometry prior to starting treatment. He will see our specialist mesothelioma nurse next week for further support and education. I have also referred him to our palliative care team for optimisation of his pain control, and our benefits advisor will assist with industrial injuries claim. We plan to commence chemotherapy in 2 weeks' time following completion of these baseline assessments.\n\nI have explained that we will monitor his response with regular clinical review and CT scanning after 3 cycles of treatment. He understands to contact us sooner if he develops any concerning symptoms, particularly breathlessness, chest pain, or fever. His wife and daughter are providing excellent support and they all demonstrated good understanding of the treatment plan discussed today.",
