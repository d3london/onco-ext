Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, stage IIIB (T4N1M0)\n\t\tDate of diagnosis\n\t\tJanuary 2024\n\n\t\tTreatment aim\n\t\tCurative intent\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2024 Diagnostic laparoscopy and biopsy\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t1. Gemcitabine/Cisplatin commenced 01 Feb 2024\n\t2. Cycle 4 completed 15 Apr 2024\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tPartial response to treatment\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tGrade 2 peripheral neuropathy\n\tMild fatigue\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tReviewed today prior to cycle 5 chemotherapy. Latest CT performed on 10/04/24 shows encouraging 40% reduction in size of perihilar mass from 6.8cm to 4.1cm, with reduced biliary obstruction. Portal vein involvement appears stable. Liver function tests have normalized. Performance status remains 1. Main side effect is grade 2 peripheral neuropathy affecting fingers and toes, managed with gabapentin 300mg TDS. Mild fatigue but maintaining daily activities. Weight stable at 72kg.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tRepeat CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after cycle 6\n\tLiver function tests weekly\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tGabapentin dose increased to 400mg TDS\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up in 3 weeks pre cycle 6\nMDT discussion planned after completion of cycle 6\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly blood tests including FBC, U&Es, LFTs\nMonitor neuropathy symptoms",
