She continues on Dabrafenib with good tolerance and no significant side effects. Her seizures remain well-controlled on current anti-epileptic medication. Performance status remains 0. No new neurological symptoms. Recent surveillance MRI shows stable appearances of residual disease with no evidence of progression.\n\nExamination shows no new neurological deficits. Visual fields full to confrontation. Normal gait.\n\nPlan is to continue current treatment and arrange next surveillance MRI in 3 months. Will review in clinic with results.",
