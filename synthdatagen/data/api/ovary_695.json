High grade serous carcinoma of ovary\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2024 Diagnostic laparoscopy and biopsy\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t1. Carboplatin AUC5 and Paclitaxel 175mg/m2 3-weekly - completed 3 cycles\n\t2. Maintenance Niraparib 200mg daily commenced 15 March 2024\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNIRAVO-OV22 trial screening in progress\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tStable disease on CT 12 April 2024\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tGrade 2 thrombocytopenia, Grade 1 fatigue\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tCase discussed at Gynae-oncology MDT today. 54-year-old lady with stage IIIC high grade serous ovarian cancer, BRCA1 VUS detected, HRD positive. Completed 3 cycles carboplatin/paclitaxel with partial response. Started maintenance Niraparib in March 2024.\n\nLatest CT shows stable disease with reduction in peritoneal disease compared to baseline. CA125 has decreased from 450 to 125. Currently experiencing grade 2 thrombocytopenia (platelets 75) and grade 1 fatigue on Niraparib.\n\nMDT recommendations:\n1. Continue Niraparib at current dose with weekly platelet monitoring\n2. Proceed with NIRAVO-OV22 trial screening if platelets recover to >100\n3. Repeat CT in 3 months\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tWeekly FBC\nRepeat CT chest/abdomen/pelvis in 3 months\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tNiraparib 200mg daily to continue\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up in 2 weeks with blood results\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly FBC monitoring\nPlease inform team if platelets <75",
