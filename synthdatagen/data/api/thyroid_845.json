Initially presenting with a rapidly enlarging neck mass in December 2023, biopsy confirmed anaplastic thyroid carcinoma with TP53 mutation. Attempted surgical debulking was unsuccessful due to extensive local invasion. Despite emergency palliative radiotherapy and two cycles of chemotherapy, disease has continued to progress both locally and systemically.\n\nCurrent performance status is ECOG 3-4, spending most time in bed. Requires continuous oxygen support at 4L/min via nasal cannula. Nutrition is maintained via NG tube due to complete dysphagia. CT scan on 15 April 2024 shows enlarging neck mass now measuring 12x8cm with progressive tracheal compression, and new bilateral pulmonary metastases.\n\nGiven rapid deterioration despite treatment and poor performance status, focus of care has shifted to symptom management. I have had detailed discussions with [redacted name] and family regarding prognosis and goals of care.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tNone planned\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tDexamethasone 8mg BD\nOxycodone MR 40mg BD\nOxycodone IR 5mg PRN\nMetoclopramide 10mg TDS\n\n\tFollow up\n\tReferral made to local palliative care team for ongoing support\nHospital palliative care team reviewing daily during admission\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPalliative care team will coordinate community support\nDNACPR in place\nPreferred place of care documented as hospice when appropriate\n\n\tSummary of information given to patient\n\tFull discussion held with patient and family regarding poor prognosis and transition to palliative care approach. Family aware of likely prognosis of weeks rather than months.",
