Performance status remains 1 with stable weight and good appetite. Main symptoms are mild right upper quadrant discomfort and occasional dry cough. Examination shows no new concerns.\n\nWe have discussed the role of targeted therapy with Pemigatinib given the presence of FGFR2 fusion. [redacted name] understands this is a newer treatment approach with monitoring requirements including regular phosphate levels and ophthalmology review. We will commence treatment next week following baseline eye examination.\n\nPlan:\nBaseline ophthalmology assessment arranged for 22 April 2024\nCommence Pemigatinib 13.5mg daily from 24 April 2024\nWeekly blood tests including phosphate levels\nCT assessment after 8 weeks\nReview in clinic in 2 weeks with blood results",
