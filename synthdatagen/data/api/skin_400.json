He was diagnosed in January 2024 with a 3.2cm Merkel cell carcinoma on his right lower leg, which was initially treated with wide local excision. Subsequent staging revealed metastatic disease to T12 vertebra, treated with palliative radiotherapy. Molecular analysis shows the tumor is MCPyV negative with high PD-L1 expression (90% CPS).\n\nHe has completed all screening investigations including cardiac echo (normal), baseline CT chest/abdomen/pelvis showing stable disease, and brain MRI showing no metastases. Blood tests including hepatitis screen, HIV, and autoimmune profile are all satisfactory for trial entry. His performance status remains 1.\n\nI have discussed the trial protocol in detail, including the randomization process, treatment schedule, and potential side effects of dual checkpoint inhibition. He understands the additional monitoring requirements and has signed the informed consent forms.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tBaseline trial-mandated blood tests completed\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tTrial medication to commence as per protocol\n\n\tFollow up\n\tFirst trial treatment scheduled for 25 April 2024\nWeekly review for first 12 weeks as per protocol\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tAlert trial team if any new symptoms or concurrent medications\nWeekly blood tests as per protocol schedule provided\n\n\tSummary of information given to the patient\n\tTrial protocol handbook provided\nTrial team contact details given\nAlert card for immunotherapy side effects provided",
