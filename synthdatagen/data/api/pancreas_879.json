  "content": "Diagnosis:\tPancreatic glucagonoma with liver metastases\n\nManagement:\t2023 Oct - Started Lanreotide 120mg q4weekly\n\t\t2023 Nov - Commenced CAPTEM chemotherapy\n\nHistology:\tWell-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (glucagonoma), Ki67 35%, Grade 2\n\nCurrent Situation:\tPre cycle 4 CAPTEM review\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today prior to cycle 4 CAPTEM chemotherapy. His glucagon levels have improved from 670 to 240 pmol/L, with corresponding improvement in the characteristic rash. Latest CT performed on 15/02/2024 shows stable disease in both pancreatic primary (4.2cm) and liver metastases. Blood glucose control remains challenging but has stabilized with adjustment of insulin regime.\n\nHe has experienced grade 2 thrombocytopenia (platelets 89) and grade 1 neutropenia from previous cycle, but counts have now recovered sufficiently. Some mild peripheral neuropathy noted but not limiting activities. Performance status remains 1.\n\nLiver function tests show stable mild derangement with ALT 82, ALP 156. Chromogranin A trending down at 185 (previously 320).\n\nPlan to proceed with cycle 4 CAPTEM at current 80% dose reduction. Will continue monthly Lanreotide. Next review in 3 weeks with repeat biochemistry and glucagon levels. CT reassessment planned after cycle 6.",
