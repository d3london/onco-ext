She remains well with no concerning symptoms. Her TSH is well-controlled on Levothyroxine 125mcg daily at 0.3 mU/L. Thyroglobulin remains undetectable (<0.1 μg/L) with negative thyroglobulin antibodies. Neck examination shows well-healed thyroidectomy scar with no palpable abnormalities. She will continue current dose of Levothyroxine and we will see her in 6 months with repeat thyroglobulin measurement and neck ultrasound as per protocol.",
