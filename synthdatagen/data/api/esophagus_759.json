He has made an excellent recovery from his esophagectomy with minimal post-operative complications. His swallowing has gradually improved and he is now managing a soft diet supplemented with nutritional drinks. His weight has stabilized at 72kg (pre-treatment weight 78kg). Performance status has improved to PS1.\n\nGiven his high-risk pathological features (ypT3N1 with lymphovascular invasion) and PDL1 CPS score of 25, I have discussed with him the role of adjuvant immunotherapy. The CheckMate 577 trial data shows significant disease-free survival benefit with adjuvant nivolumab in this setting. He understands the potential benefits and risks, including immune-related adverse events.\n\nPlan:\nTo commence adjuvant nivolumab 480mg every 4 weeks for one year\nBaseline thyroid function, cortisol, and chest x-ray arranged\nProvided immunotherapy alert card and education regarding side effects\nFollow-up in 4 weeks prior to cycle 2\nRepeat CT scan in 3 months",
