  "content": "Diagnosis:\tClear cell renal cell carcinoma, right kidney, T1bN0M0\n\nCT abdomen/pelvis 15 March 2024 showed 5.2cm mass in right kidney lower pole, no evidence of local invasion or lymphadenopathy. CT chest same date showed no evidence of metastatic disease. PET-CT 22 March 2024 confirmed solitary right renal mass with no evidence of distant disease.\n\n[redacted name] is a 64-year-old gentleman who was recently diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma following investigation of microscopic haematuria. He is otherwise well with good performance status (WHO PS 0). He has well-controlled hypertension on ramipril 5mg daily but no other significant medical history. He is an ex-smoker having quit 10 years ago.\n\nOn examination today, he is comfortable at rest with normal vital signs. Abdominal examination reveals no masses or tenderness. Chest is clear.\n\nI have discussed his case with [redacted name] from urology. Given the size and location of the tumor, he is suitable for partial nephrectomy. This has been discussed with the patient today who wishes to proceed. I have explained the procedure, including potential risks and recovery period. His case will be discussed at next week's uro-oncology MDT.\n\nThe plan is for surgical resection followed by surveillance. Given the stage and PD-L1 negative status, adjuvant therapy is not indicated. We will arrange follow-up CT chest/abdomen/pelvis at 3 months post-surgery.",
