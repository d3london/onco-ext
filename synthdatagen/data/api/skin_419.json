The surgical site has healed well with minimal scarring. She reports no ongoing pain or sensitivity at the treatment site. Her energy levels have returned to normal following radiotherapy completion. Performance status remains 0.\n\nThe most recent CT neck performed on 15 June 2024 shows no evidence of regional recurrence or distant metastases. Blood tests including renal function are satisfactory.\n\nPlan is for ongoing surveillance with 3-monthly clinical reviews for the first year. I have provided written information about sun protection and skin self-examination. Next appointment arranged for September 2024 with repeat CT neck prior to review.",
