Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of cervix, T4aN0M0 (FIGO Stage IVA)\n\t   Date of diagnosis\n\t   January 2024\n\t   Treatment aim\n\t   Curative intent\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t12 Jan 2024 Diagnostic cervical biopsy\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tNot yet commenced\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tNot yet commenced\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tENROL-456 Phase II trial of Carboplatin/Etoposide with concurrent radiotherapy\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tLocally advanced disease with bladder invasion\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tIntermittent haematuria, pelvic pain\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 42-year-old lady attended clinic today for trial screening and registration. Diagnosis was confirmed on cervical biopsy showing small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, strongly positive for Chromogranin A and Synaptophysin. MRI pelvis from 28/01/24 shows a 6.2cm cervical mass with invasion into the posterior bladder wall but no lymphadenopathy or distant metastases. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis confirms no evidence of distant disease.\n\nI have discussed the ENROL-456 trial in detail, which involves 4 cycles of Carboplatin AUC5 and Etoposide 100mg/m2 with concurrent chemoradiation (50.4Gy in 28 fractions) starting from cycle 2. The patient understands the trial requirements including weekly reviews, quality of life questionnaires, and additional blood samples for translational research. We have reviewed the potential side effects including fatigue, myelosuppression, nausea, and radiation-related toxicities.\n\nBaseline investigations today show normal renal and liver function, Hb 118, WCC 8.2, Platelets 342. Performance status is 1 due to pelvic pain requiring regular analgesia. The patient meets all eligibility criteria.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tBaseline PET-CT scheduled 15/02/24\n\tBaseline audiometry and EDTA clearance booked 16/02/24\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tCo-codamol 30/500mg QDS PRN\n\tOndansetron 8mg BD PRN\n\n\tFollow up\n\tTrial registration visit completed\n\tCycle 1 chemotherapy planned for 19/02/24\n\tWeekly review during treatment as per protocol\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly FBC, U&Es, LFTs during treatment\n\tPrescribe antiemetics as per protocol\n\n\tSummary of information given to the patient\n\tTrial information sheet provided and consent obtained\n\tEmergency contact card given\n\tWritten chemotherapy information provided",
