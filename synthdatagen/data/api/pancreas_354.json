  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMetastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma with liver metastases\n\nManagement:\t2023 Oct - Carboplatin/Etoposide chemotherapy\n\t\t2024 Jan - Second-line CAPTEM (Capecitabine/Temozolomide)\n\nHistology:\tPoorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma, Ki-67 80%\n\nCurrent Situation:\tProgressive disease on CAPTEM\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following recent CT imaging. Unfortunately, this shows clear disease progression with enlarging liver metastases and new peritoneal deposits. The largest liver lesion has increased from 4.2cm to 6.8cm over 8 weeks. Chromogranin A has risen from 280 to 450. Performance status has declined to ECOG 2, with increasing fatigue and right upper quadrant pain requiring regular breakthrough analgesia. Weight has dropped by 4kg since last review.\n\nThe patient is now spending more than 50% of the day resting and requires assistance with activities of daily living. Examination shows tender hepatomegaly and peripheral edema. Given the clear evidence of disease progression and declining performance status, we have discussed discontinuing CAPTEM chemotherapy. I have explained that further systemic therapy options are limited but we could consider clinical trial participation if performance status improves with supportive care.\n\nI have increased MST to 30mg bd and arranged urgent palliative care review. Will reassess in 2 weeks to discuss further options including potential phase 1 trials if appropriate. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis to be repeated in 6 weeks if clinically indicated.",
