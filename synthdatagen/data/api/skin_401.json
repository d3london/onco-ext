The lesion was initially excised on 15/3/24 at his local hospital, showing a 4.2mm Breslow thickness melanoma with ulceration and a mitotic rate of 6/mm2. He underwent completion wide local excision and right axillary lymph node dissection on 2/4/24, which showed 3/21 nodes positive with no extracapsular spread.\n\nMolecular testing has confirmed BRAF V600K mutation and PD-L1 expression of 60%. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis and MRI brain on 10/4/24 showed no evidence of distant metastatic disease. His wound sites are healing well with no evidence of in-transit metastases.\n\nHe has type 2 diabetes managed with metformin and gliclazide, and hypertension controlled on ramipril. He is otherwise fit and well with PS 0. On examination today, his surgical sites show good healing with no concerning features. There is no palpable lymphadenopathy or suspicious skin lesions.\n\nI have discussed the role of adjuvant systemic therapy given his high-risk stage III disease. We have agreed to commence combination immunotherapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab, with detailed discussion of the schedule, side effects, and monitoring requirements. He will start treatment next week following completion of his baseline blood tests and chest x-ray. We will arrange regular skin surveillance with our specialist nurse team.\n\nThe plan is to commence nivolumab 1mg/kg and ipilimumab 3mg/kg 3-weekly for 4 cycles, followed by nivolumab maintenance. I will review him prior to cycle 1 next week and have provided emergency contact details. He will be monitored closely by our melanoma team throughout his treatment course.",
