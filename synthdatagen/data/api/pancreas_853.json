She remains well with no new symptoms since her surgery last year. Her appetite is good and weight is stable at 68kg. Recent chromogranin A level shows continued stability at 82 (previously 85). CT pancreas protocol performed 2 weeks ago shows post-surgical changes only with no evidence of recurrence. Blood glucose remains well controlled on metformin.\n\nThe plan is to continue surveillance as per protocol. I have arranged chromogranin A testing for 3 months and CT scan in 6 months. We will review her again following these investigations.",
