Initial staging showed extensive pelvic lymphadenopathy and widespread metastatic disease. He completed 4 cycles with good tolerance apart from grade 2 fatigue. Restaging CT in March 2024 confirmed stable disease and he proceeded to prophylactic cranial irradiation followed by maintenance atezolizumab.\n\nHe has developed mild thyroiditis on immunotherapy requiring thyroxine replacement but otherwise tolerating treatment well. Latest thyroid function shows TSH 5.2 with normal free T4. Performance status remains 1.\n\nOn examination today, he has stable abdominal findings with no new concerns. Recent cystoscopy shows no local progression.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tCT chest/abdomen/pelvis booked for 20 May 2024\nTFTs to be monitored weekly\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tAtezolizumab 1200mg q21 days\nLevothyroxine 50mcg daily\n\n\tFollow up\n\tTransferring care to local oncology unit at [redacted name] Hospital\nNext immunotherapy due 15 May 2024\nRequires 3-monthly CT imaging\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly TFT monitoring\nUrgent referral back if new neurological symptoms",
