Recent CT imaging shows increase in size of liver metastases and new peritoneal deposits with associated ascites. Her performance status has declined from ECOG 1 to ECOG 2-3, largely due to increasing abdominal pain and fatigue. She has required two therapeutic paracenteses in the past month for symptomatic ascites.\n\nThe initial GEMCIS chemotherapy was complicated by grade 4 neutropenia after cycle 2, requiring a 2-week delay and subsequent 25% dose reduction. Despite this, she has developed progressive disease after 3 cycles.\n\nAfter careful discussion with [redacted name] and her daughter today, we have agreed to discontinue GEMCIS and switch to weekly single-agent gemcitabine at a reduced dose of 800mg/m2. This decision takes into account her declining performance status and the need to prioritize quality of life while still attempting to slow disease progression.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tWeekly FBC, U&Es, LFTs during treatment\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tOxycodone MR 20mg BD increased from 10mg BD\nMetoclopramide 10mg TDS PRN\n\n\tFollow up\n\tWeekly review during gemcitabine treatment\nUrgent palliative care referral made\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPlease monitor for increasing analgesic requirements\nEarly review if symptoms worsen\n\n\tSummary of information given to patient\n\tDiscussed poor prognosis and aims of palliative chemotherapy\nProvided written information about gemcitabine side effects",
