Latest CT chest 15/12/23 shows stable disease with no change in the three pulmonary metastases (largest 2.1cm right lower lobe). Blood results are satisfactory for treatment continuation. She reports grade 2 peripheral neuropathy affecting fingers and toes, but wishes to continue current doses given disease control. Performance status remains 1. No new symptoms. Examination shows well-healed right parotid surgical site with no evidence of local recurrence. Plan to proceed with cycle 6 today and arrange repeat CT chest/abdomen/pelvis prior to cycle 8 review. Will see again in 3 weeks with blood results.",
