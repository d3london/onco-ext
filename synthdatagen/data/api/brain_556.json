He remains seizure-free on levetiracetam 750mg twice daily. His neurological examination is normal with no new focal deficits. Performance status remains 0.\n\nSurveillance MRI brain performed on 15 March 2024 shows post-operative changes in the right temporal lobe with no evidence of disease recurrence. This is stable compared to previous imaging from September 2023.\n\nThe plan is to continue current anti-epileptic medication and arrange next surveillance MRI in 6 months. We will review him in clinic following this scan. He understands to contact us sooner if any new symptoms develop.",
