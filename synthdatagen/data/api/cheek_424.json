The surgical site on the right cheek has healed well with an excellent cosmetic result. There is no evidence of recurrence on careful examination of the scar and surrounding skin. No suspicious lesions noted elsewhere on head and neck examination.\n\nThe patient reports no new skin concerns and understands the importance of sun protection and self-monitoring. They are managing well with regular sunscreen use and appropriate protective clothing.\n\nPlan is for final follow-up in 6 months' time with clinical photographs, after which discharge to GP care if remains well. Written information provided regarding signs of recurrence to monitor for.",
