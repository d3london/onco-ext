She remains seizure-free on Levetiracetam 750mg BD, which she tolerates well. Her most recent MRI brain (15/4/24) shows stable appearances of the residual right temporal DNET with no new features of concern. Her neurological examination remains normal with no focal deficits. Performance status is 0. She continues to work full-time and maintains good quality of life. The plan is to continue current anti-epileptic medication and arrange repeat MRI brain in 6 months with clinic review thereafter. She understands to contact us sooner if new symptoms develop.",
