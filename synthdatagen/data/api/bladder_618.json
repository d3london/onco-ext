He is currently PS 1 with mild fatigue but maintaining normal activities. Main symptoms are intermittent visible haematuria and right upper quadrant discomfort. Weight stable. Examination shows mild right upper quadrant tenderness but no other significant findings.\n\nI have discussed treatment options including standard chemotherapy with gemcitabine/cisplatin versus potential targeted therapy given the PPARG rearrangement. We have agreed to proceed with chemotherapy initially given the symptom burden, with consideration of targeted agents at progression. He understands the aims are to control rather than cure the disease.\n\nPlan is to arrange PICC line insertion next week, baseline cardiac echo and proceed with cycle 1 gemcitabine/cisplatin. Will review after first cycle and arrange CT assessment after 3 cycles. I have provided written chemotherapy information and emergency contact details.",
