He has recovered well from his chemoradiotherapy which completed 8 weeks ago. His bowel function has largely returned to normal with 2-3 formed motions daily. He reports no bleeding or pain. His appetite has improved and his weight is stable at 72kg. Performance status remains 0.\n\nOn examination today, digital rectal examination shows good healing with no palpable abnormality. Blood tests show stable parameters with CEA 2.1 (previously 2.3).\n\nI have arranged an MRI pelvis for 3 months' time to assess treatment response, followed by clinic review. I have explained the surveillance plan which he understands. He has contact details for the specialist nursing team if any concerns arise before then.",
