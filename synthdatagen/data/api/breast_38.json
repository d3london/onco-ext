She has managed the treatment journey remarkably well and maintains a very positive outlook. The radiation-induced skin changes are settling nicely, with only mild residual pigmentation in the treated area. She reports gradually improving energy levels and has been steadily increasing her daily walking, now managing 30 minutes most days.\n\nShe experienced some expected fatigue during radiotherapy but this is now improving. Her shoulder mobility has returned to normal following the exercises recommended by our breast care physiotherapist. She has been taking tamoxifen 20mg daily for the past 6 weeks and reports only mild hot flushes which are not significantly impacting her quality of life.\n\nOn examination today, there is good healing of both the surgical scar and radiotherapy field. No concerning features are identified in either breast or axillae.\n\nI have explained that we will now transition to our standard follow-up protocol. She will be seen in the nurse-led clinic in 3 months' time, then 6-monthly for the first two years. Annual mammograms will be arranged through our breast screening service. I have provided written information about potential tamoxifen side effects and encouraged her to contact our breast care nurses if she develops any concerns. She understands to report any new breast symptoms promptly.\n\nThe plan is to continue tamoxifen for 5 years in total, with annual medication reviews through her GP. I have also recommended maintaining her current exercise regime and healthy lifestyle measures.",
