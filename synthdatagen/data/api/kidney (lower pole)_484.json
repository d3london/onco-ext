Deteriorating performance status\n\t2. Increasing right upper quadrant pain\n\t3. Symptomatic hypercalcemia\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 62-year-old gentleman has unfortunately shown clear evidence of disease progression on his most recent imaging. CT performed on 1 May 2024 demonstrates enlargement of existing liver metastases and appearance of three new lesions in segments 7 and 8. There is also progression of bone metastases with new lesions in T8 and L3 vertebrae.\n\nHis performance status has declined to ECOG 2-3, spending more than 50% of the day resting. He reports increasing right upper quadrant pain requiring escalation of opioid analgesia, now on MST 60mg BD. Recent blood tests show rising calcium at 3.1mmol/L despite previous zoledronic acid.\n\nOn examination today, there is marked hepatomegaly extending 4cm below costal margin with tenderness on palpation. Reduced air entry at right lung base. No peripheral edema.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\t1. Urgent serum calcium and renal function\n\t2. MRI spine to assess cord compression risk at T8\n\n\tMedication changes\n\t1. Commenced on urgent IV fluids and zoledronic acid for hypercalcemia\n\t2. MST increased to 90mg BD\n\t3. Cabozantinib discontinued due to disease progression\n\n\tFollow up\n\t1. Urgent review in 1 week with blood results\n\t2. Discussion at RCC MDT regarding second-line therapy options\n\n\tRequired actions\n\t1. Referral to palliative care team completed\n\t2. District nurse referral for support with medication administration\n\t3. GP to monitor renal function and calcium levels twice weekly",
