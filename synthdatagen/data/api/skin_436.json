The surgical site has healed well with an acceptable cosmetic outcome. He has no new skin lesions or concerning symptoms. The right temple area shows a well-healed 2cm scar with no evidence of recurrence. There is no palpable lymphadenopathy in the head and neck region.\n\nI have performed a complete skin examination today which shows no new suspicious lesions. We have discussed sun protection measures and skin surveillance. He will continue with 3-monthly skin checks with his local dermatologist. I will review him again in 6 months' time with repeat photography.",
