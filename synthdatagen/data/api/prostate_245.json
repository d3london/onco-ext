He has new choroidal metastasis causing visual symptoms and progressive bone disease. Given the molecular profile showing AURKA amplification and aggressive clinical course, we will switch to platinum-based chemotherapy with carboplatin/etoposide. He understands the aims and risks of treatment. He will also require urgent radiotherapy to the right orbit.\n\nPlan:\n1. Commence carboplatin AUC 5 D1 and etoposide 100mg/m2 D1-3 q21 days\n2. Urgent referral for orbital radiotherapy\n3. Continue denosumab and ADT\n4. Review in 2 weeks with blood tests\n5. Repeat imaging after 2 cycles",
