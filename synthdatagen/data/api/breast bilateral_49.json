She reports increasing breathlessness on exertion and persistent dry cough for the past 3 weeks. Her performance status has declined to ECOG 2 from previous ECOG 1. Blood tests show rising CA15-3 at 145 (previously 89). Given detection of ESR1 mutation and disease progression on current endocrine therapy, we will switch treatment to oral Capivasertib with Fulvestrant. I have discussed the side effect profile including potential hyperglycemia and diarrhea. She will start treatment next week following baseline echocardiogram. Review arranged in 2 weeks with blood tests.\n",
