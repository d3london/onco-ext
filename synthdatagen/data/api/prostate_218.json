He has made an excellent recovery from his radical prostatectomy performed in March 2023. His urinary continence has continued to improve and he now requires only one pad per day. Erectile function is gradually recovering with the help of tadalafil. His latest PSA from last week is <0.01, showing no evidence of biochemical recurrence. Clinical examination today was unremarkable. He will continue with 3-monthly PSA monitoring and I will review him again in clinic in 6 months' time.",
