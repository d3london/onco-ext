  "content": "Diagnosis:\tDescending colon adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features, Duke's B (pT3N0M0)\n\nI was pleased to review [redacted name] in the colorectal oncology follow-up clinic today. She has been doing remarkably well since completing adjuvant CAPOX chemotherapy in January 2024, maintaining an excellent quality of life and gradually returning to her normal activities. She has now fully recovered from her previous chemotherapy-related peripheral neuropathy.\n\nShe underwent left hemicolectomy on 15th August 2023, with histology confirming a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features. Molecular testing identified an NTRK3-ETV6 fusion. Following MDT discussion, she completed 6 cycles of adjuvant CAPOX chemotherapy, which she tolerated well aside from grade 2 peripheral neuropathy that has now resolved.?\n\nHer recent surveillance CT scan from March 2024 shows no evidence of recurrent disease, and her CEA remains stable at 2.4 μg/L. Her latest blood tests show stable renal and liver function.?\n\nThe plan is to continue with our standard follow-up protocol. I have arranged her next CT scan for September 2024 and will see her back in clinic with those results. She understands to contact us sooner if she develops any new concerning symptoms.",
