She has tolerated the first two cycles reasonably well with only grade 1 nausea and mild fatigue. Her main side effect has been complete alopecia which she was prepared for. No febrile episodes. Performance status remains 0. Blood results today show neutrophils 2.8, platelets 156, and normal liver function. Examination shows good healing of the breast wound with no concerning features. She is keen to proceed with the next cycle. I am happy for her to continue with cycle 3 EC today as planned. We will see her again before cycle 4.",
