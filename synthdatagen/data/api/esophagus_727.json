Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\tNot indicated\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\t15 Feb 2024 - Whole brain radiotherapy 20Gy in 5 fractions\n\t1 Mar 2024 - Palliative radiotherapy to T8 vertebra 8Gy single fraction\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tJan-Mar 2024 - 3 cycles Cisplatin/5-FU/Pembrolizumab\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease with clinical deterioration\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Progressive dysphagia requiring NG feeding\n\t2. Worsening bone pain\n\t3. New onset confusion and ataxia\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 62-year-old gentleman was reviewed today with his wife and daughter. Unfortunately, he has experienced significant clinical deterioration over the past 2 weeks. His dysphagia has worsened requiring NG feeding, and he is experiencing increased bone pain despite optimal analgesia. Most concerning is the development of new confusion and unsteady gait over the past 72 hours.\n\nUrgent MRI brain performed yesterday shows progression of known cerebral metastases with increasing perilesional edema, despite whole brain radiotherapy completed 6 weeks ago. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis demonstrates progressive disease with enlarging liver metastases and new pulmonary nodules. His performance status has declined from ECOG 2 to 3-4.\n\nAfter careful discussion with [redacted name] and his family, we have made the decision to discontinue systemic anti-cancer therapy given his marked clinical deterioration and poor performance status. The focus will shift to optimal symptom control.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tNone planned\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\t1. Dexamethasone 8mg BD\n\t2. Increased MST to 60mg BD\n\t3. Continued antiemetics\n\n\tFollow up\n\t1. Urgent referral to palliative care team - completed today\n\t2. Community palliative care referral - completed today\n\t3. Next oncology review in 1 week\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\t1. Please monitor neurological status\n\t2. Support with community palliative care engagement\n\t3. Consider home visit given reduced mobility",
