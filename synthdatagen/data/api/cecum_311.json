The patient has experienced improving tolerance since dose reduction. Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy persists but has not worsened. Fatigue is manageable with appropriate rest periods. No diarrhea or hand-foot syndrome. Blood tests show stable parameters with adequate neutrophil count.\n\nOn examination, wound sites are well-healed. Abdomen is soft and non-tender with normal bowel sounds. No peripheral edema. Latest CEA is 2.4 (within normal range).\n\nGiven the discordant MMR status between the two tumors, genetic counseling referral has been arranged. The significance of MLH1/PMS2 loss in the distal tumor has been discussed, including implications for family screening.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tCT chest/abdomen/pelvis scheduled for completion of chemotherapy\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tContinue CAPOX at current dose (75% of starting dose)\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up in 3 weeks for cycle 5\nGenetics clinic appointment pending\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly FBC, U&E monitoring\nPlease refer urgently if new neurological symptoms develop",
