  "content": "Many thanks for referring [redacted name] who I reviewed today with his wife and daughter present. This 56-year-old gentleman has unfortunately been diagnosed with metastatic giant cell carcinoma of the lung with extensive leptomeningeal disease. His symptoms began approximately 8 weeks ago with persistent headaches and diplopia, initially attributed to migraine. Following development of left-sided facial weakness and gait disturbance, he underwent urgent MRI brain on 15th March 2024 which revealed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement. CT chest identified a 7.2cm right lower lobe mass, and subsequent bronchoscopic biopsy confirmed giant cell carcinoma. PET-CT staging on 22nd March demonstrated the primary lung lesion with extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy but no other sites of distant disease. MRI spine completed yesterday shows extensive leptomeningeal disease throughout the neuraxis.\n\nMolecular analysis has revealed PD-L1 expression of 100% and EGFR amplification, though notably without activating mutations. His neurological symptoms have unfortunately progressed rapidly over the past week, with worsening headaches despite dexamethasone 8mg twice daily, increased difficulty with balance, and new onset confusion. He requires a wheelchair for mobility and assistance with most activities of daily living, corresponding to a performance status of 3.\n\nOn examination today, he is alert but disorientated to time. There is a left-sided facial nerve palsy, diplopia on left lateral gaze, and reduced power in both legs (MRC grade 4/5). Truncal ataxia is evident on sitting.\n\nI have discussed his case in detail with our neuro-oncology colleagues. Given the extensive leptomeningeal disease and poor performance status, we have significant concerns about his ability to tolerate systemic therapy. However, in view of his young age, rapid decline, and highly favourable molecular profile, we propose to cautiously trial durvalumab plus tremelimumab, with concurrent intrathecal methotrexate. I have explained to the family that this represents a high-risk strategy with significant potential for neurological deterioration, but also offers the best chance of meaningful disease control.\n\nWe have arranged urgent insertion of an Ommaya reservoir tomorrow morning. Subject to successful insertion, we plan to commence intrathecal methotrexate on Friday, followed by immunotherapy next week if his clinical status remains stable. He will require admission to our oncology ward for initiation of treatment and close neurological monitoring. I have also referred him to our palliative care team for additional support with symptom management.\n\nWe will review him daily during admission and adjust our treatment strategy based on his tolerance and response. His wife and daughter demonstrate good understanding of the significant risks involved but wish to proceed with treatment given the lack of alternative options. They have my direct contact details should they have any concerns before admission tomorrow.",
