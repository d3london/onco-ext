  "content": "Diagnosis:\tProstate cancer - right zone ductal adenocarcinoma, Stage IIIB (T3bN1M0), diagnosed March 2024\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today to discuss enrollment in the PARADIGM-2 trial. His prostate cancer was diagnosed following elevated PSA of 89.2 in January 2024, with subsequent MRI and targeted biopsy confirming right-sided ductal adenocarcinoma with extracapsular extension and right pelvic nodal involvement. Genetic testing has identified a pathogenic HOXB13 mutation.\n\nHe completed staging investigations last week, including CT chest/abdomen/pelvis and bone scan which confirmed right pelvic nodal disease but no distant metastases. His latest PSA has improved to 45.6 following androgen deprivation therapy initiated on 15/3/24.\n\nI have discussed the PARADIGM-2 trial in detail, which compares standard ADT plus docetaxel versus ADT plus docetaxel and novel AR-targeted therapy. He meets all eligibility criteria including adequate organ function, ECOG PS 0, and no contraindications to proposed treatments. We reviewed the trial schedule, potential side effects, and additional monitoring requirements.\n\nHe has signed the informed consent after thorough discussion. Trial screening investigations are scheduled for next week including baseline CT, bone scan, ECG, and blood tests. The randomisation visit is planned for 15/4/24 assuming all screening criteria are met.\n\nI have provided written information about the trial and emergency contact details. He will be reviewed weekly during the first cycle of treatment with regular PSA monitoring as per protocol. His next appointment is scheduled for the randomisation visit on 15/4/24.",
