Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, distal common bile duct\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t12 Jan 2024 ERCP and stent insertion\n\tChemotherapy\n\t1. Gemcitabine/Cisplatin commenced 25 Jan 2024\n\t2. Completed 4 cycles with 25% dose reduction from cycle 3\n\t3. Treatment discontinued 15 Apr 2024 due to disease progression\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNot eligible for FGFR2 inhibitor trial due to negative fusion status\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease with increasing lymphadenopathy and new peritoneal deposits\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Deteriorating performance status\n\t2. Increasing jaundice\n\t3. Abdominal pain requiring opioid analgesia\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 67-year-old gentleman attended clinic today accompanied by his wife and daughter. Unfortunately, recent imaging has confirmed disease progression despite chemotherapy, with increasing porta hepatis and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and new peritoneal deposits. His performance status has declined to ECOG 3, spending more than 50% of time in bed. He describes worsening abdominal pain requiring increased doses of oxycodone, and his jaundice has deepened with bilirubin now at 156 μmol/L despite the biliary stent.\n\nOn examination, he appears cachectic with obvious jaundice. There is moderate ascites with shifting dullness. Tender hepatomegaly extends 4cm below the costal margin.\n\nGiven his deteriorating condition and confirmed disease progression, we have made the difficult decision to discontinue systemic therapy. This has been discussed at length with [redacted name] and his family, who understand and agree with focusing on symptom management.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tUrgent ultrasound to assess stent patency\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\t1. Oxycodone MR increased to 40mg BD\n\t2. Breakthrough oxycodone 10mg PRN\n\t3. Regular ondansetron\n\n\tFollow up\n\t1. Urgent referral to palliative care team - completed today\n\t2. Weekly review by community palliative care team\n\t3. Open access to acute oncology service\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\t1. Please monitor renal function and electrolytes weekly\n\t2. Titrate analgesia as guided by palliative care team\n\t3. Consider vitamin K if coagulopathy develops",
