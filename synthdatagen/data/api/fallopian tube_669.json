High grade serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) of right fallopian tube\n\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tMarch 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tCurative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Mar 2024 Risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\n\tIncidental finding of STIC in right fallopian tube\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tNot indicated given stage\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tNot indicated\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tNo evidence of disease\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tMild post-surgical menopausal symptoms\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 45-year-old lady was reviewed today following completion of her surgical treatment. She underwent risk-reducing surgery due to strong family history of ovarian cancer and presence of BRCA1 variant of uncertain significance. Histopathology revealed an incidental finding of STIC lesion in the right fallopian tube, with no invasion and negative peritoneal washings.\n\nShe has recovered well from surgery with minimal complications. She reports some mild hot flushes and night sweats which are gradually improving. She has commenced on HRT as discussed with her gynecologist.\n\nWe have discussed the excellent prognosis given the very early stage of disease. Given the incidental nature of the finding and complete surgical resection, no adjuvant treatment is indicated.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tRoutine CA125 monitoring\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tNone from oncology\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up in 3 months with CA125\nAnnual gynecology follow-up arranged\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tRoutine monitoring of menopausal symptoms\nHRT monitoring as per local guidelines\n\n\tSummary of information given to the patient\n\tExcellent prognosis discussed\nNo adjuvant treatment required\nImportance of continued surveillance explained",
