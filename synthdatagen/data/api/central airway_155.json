She remains clinically stable 12 months post-completion of radiotherapy. Her breathing is satisfactory with no stridor or new respiratory symptoms. She maintains good exercise tolerance, walking 2 miles daily. Performance status remains 0. Recent surveillance CT thorax (15/03/2024) shows stable appearance of residual tracheal thickening with no evidence of disease progression or nodal involvement. Bronchoscopy surveillance from last month showed post-radiation changes only with no evidence of active disease. Blood tests are satisfactory. The plan is to continue current surveillance schedule with next CT thorax in 3 months and clinical review thereafter. She understands to contact us sooner if any new symptoms develop.",
