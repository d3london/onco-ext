Prostate cancer - bilateral ductal adenocarcinoma T3aN0M0\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tCurative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\tNot indicated\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tNot yet commenced\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tNot indicated\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tPROTECT-2 trial of novel androgen receptor inhibitor XJ-573\n\tRandomised 15 Feb 2024\n\tCommenced treatment 01 Mar 2024\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tStable disease on trial treatment\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tGrade 1 fatigue\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 62-year-old gentleman is participating in the PROTECT-2 trial and attended for his week 8 assessment. His PSA has decreased from 23.4 at baseline to 4.2, representing an excellent biochemical response. He reports mild fatigue but maintains his usual activities. No other toxicities noted. Trial-mandated blood tests show stable liver function and testosterone remains adequately suppressed at <0.3nmol/L.\n\nOn examination today, digital rectal examination shows reduction in prostatic induration compared to baseline. No new concerning features. Performance status remains 0.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tTrial-mandated MRI prostate scheduled for 15 May 2024\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tTrial medication (XJ-573 vs placebo) continuing at full dose\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext trial assessment in 4 weeks with PSA, testosterone, and liver function\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPlease monitor blood pressure weekly as per trial protocol",
