  "content": "Diagnosis:\t\tP16 positive T2N0M0 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma\n\nManagement:\t\tCompleted radical chemoradiotherapy March 2024 (70Gy in 35 fractions with concurrent cisplatin)\n\nCurrent Situation:\tFirst post-treatment review\n\n[redacted name] attended clinic today for first review following completion of radical chemoradiotherapy. He has recovered well from treatment with improving swallowing function and is now managing a soft diet. His weight has stabilized at 72kg. Mild xerostomia persists but is manageable with regular sips of water. Voice quality has returned to near baseline. No concerning symptoms reported.\n\nClinical examination shows good healing of the oropharyngeal mucosa with no evidence of residual or recurrent disease. Neck examination is unremarkable with no palpable lymphadenopathy.\n\nI have arranged a 3-month post-treatment MRI and PET-CT scan. We will review him again in clinic with these results. In the meantime, he has the contact details for our specialist nursing team should any concerns arise.",
