  "content": "Diagnosis:\t\tMetastatic lobular breast cancer, ER/HER2 positive, PIK3CA mutated\n\nManagement:\t\tPrevious right mastectomy March 2023\n\t\tCompleted adjuvant trastuzumab/pertuzumab/docetaxel x 6 cycles\n\t\tProgression with brain/bone metastases September 2023\n\t\tCompleted whole brain radiotherapy October 2023\n\t\tStarted T-DM1 November 2023\n\nCurrent Situation:\tClinical and radiological progression on T-DM1\n\n[redacted name] has unfortunately shown clear evidence of disease progression on current treatment. Recent MRI brain 15/4/24 shows multiple new enhancing lesions despite previous whole brain radiotherapy. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis confirms progression in bone metastases with new thoracic vertebral lesions. She describes worsening headaches and new onset right-sided hip pain requiring increased analgesia. Performance status has declined to ECOG 2. Blood tests show rising CA15-3 to 245 (previously 180). Given clear evidence of progression, we will discontinue T-DM1 and commence tucatinib/capecitabine/trastuzumab combination. I have prescribed dexamethasone 4mg BD for symptom control and made an urgent referral for palliative radiotherapy to the right hip. She will require close monitoring of neurological symptoms. Review arranged in one week with blood tests to commence new treatment regimen. Acute oncology team aware if deterioration before then.",
