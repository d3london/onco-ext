  "content": "Diagnosis:\nLocally advanced prostate cancer (T3aN1M0)\nDuctal adenocarcinoma, Gleason 4+5=9\nPSA at diagnosis 45.6 (March 2024)\n\nPrevious medical history:\nType 2 diabetes\nHypertension\nPrevious DVT 2020\n\nCurrent medications:\nMetformin 1g BD\nRamipril 10mg OD\nApixaban 5mg BD\n\nCurrent situation:\nDiscussed at Uro-oncology MDT 15 April 2024\n\nImaging review:\nMRI prostate (28 March 2024) shows right apical tumour with extracapsular extension and right seminal vesicle involvement. No bone metastases on isotope bone scan (2 April 2024). CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrates right external iliac and obturator lymphadenopathy up to 2.1cm.\n\nMDT Discussion:\nComprehensive discussion of treatment options for high-risk locally advanced disease with nodal involvement. Given patient's good performance status (PS 0) and absence of distant metastases, MDT consensus favours multimodal approach with radical radiotherapy to prostate and pelvic nodes following neoadjuvant hormone therapy. Alternative of radical prostatectomy with extended lymph node dissection was considered but not favoured given extent of local disease and nodal involvement.\n\nRecommended Plan:\n1. Commence androgen deprivation therapy with Leuprorelin 3-monthly depot\n2. PSA monitoring at 3 months\n3. Planning CT and radiotherapy preparation after 3-6 months of hormone therapy\n4. Proposed radiotherapy schedule: 74Gy in 37 fractions to prostate and seminal vesicles with 60Gy to pelvic nodes\n5. Consideration of 2 years total duration of hormone therapy given high-risk features\n\nPatient to be reviewed in combined clinic with clinical oncology to discuss treatment plan in detail. Urgent appointment will be arranged within 2 weeks.",
