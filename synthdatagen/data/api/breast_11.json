Diagnostic imaging showed 7.2cm left breast mass with multiple abnormal axillary nodes. Core biopsy confirmed micropapillary carcinoma, AR and GATA3 positive with high TIL score 60%. Staging CT and bone scan show no evidence of metastatic disease.\n\nI have discussed at length the IMPACT-BC trial which is investigating intensified neoadjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk early breast cancer. [redacted name] meets all eligibility criteria including adequate cardiac function (LVEF 62%) and normal baseline blood parameters. We reviewed the trial schema, randomisation process, and additional trial-specific requirements including research biopsies and more frequent cardiac monitoring.\n\nShe has good understanding of the trial aims and additional procedures required. Written informed consent obtained today following full discussion of alternative standard treatment options.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tBaseline cardiac MRI scheduled 22 Apr 2024\n\tResearch tissue collection 25 Apr 2024\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tNone\n\n\tFollow up\n\tTrial randomisation 26 Apr 2024\n\tChemotherapy teaching 29 Apr 2024\n\tFirst treatment scheduled 2 May 2024\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tNone\n\n\tSummary of information given to patient\n\tFull trial information provided including written materials\nDiscussed standard vs trial treatment options\nReviewed potential benefits and additional requirements of trial participation",
