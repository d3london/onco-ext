Treatment has been well tolerated overall with grade 2 radiation dermatitis requiring regular Flamazine application. Blood parameters remain stable with latest creatinine 82, neutrophils 2.1. No ototoxicity reported. Performance status remains 1. Examination shows expected radiation changes but no evidence of disease progression. Latest weekly cisplatin proceeded at full dose.\n\nThe plan is to continue with concurrent chemoradiotherapy as scheduled. Radiotherapy is proceeding according to protocol with good compliance. We will review again next week with blood tests. Acute oncology team aware in case of complications.",
