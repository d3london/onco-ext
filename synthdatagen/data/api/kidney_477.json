His post-operative recovery has been uncomplicated with good wound healing. His baseline renal function remains stable with creatinine 98 umol/L. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis performed on 2 May 2024 shows expected post-surgical changes with no evidence of residual or metastatic disease. Given the favourable histological features and stage, we have discussed that active surveillance is appropriate. The plan is for 3-monthly clinical review with regular cross-sectional imaging as per our surveillance protocol. The first follow-up CT scan will be arranged for 3 months' time. We will see him back in clinic with these results.",
