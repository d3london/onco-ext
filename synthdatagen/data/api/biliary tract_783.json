  "content": "Diagnosis:\n\nIntrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with lung and peritoneal metastases\n\nInitial staging CT 12 January 2024 - 8.5cm mass segment 4/8 with multiple satellite lesions, peritoneal deposits and bilateral pulmonary nodules\n\nBiopsy 15 January 2024 - Moderately differentiated intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, BRAF V600E mutation positive\n\nPrevious medical history:\nType 2 diabetes\nHypertension\nChronic kidney disease stage 3\n\nCurrent medications:\nGemcitabine/Cisplatin - currently on hold\nDabrafenib/Trametinib commenced 15 March 2024\nLansoprazole 30mg daily\nParacetamol 1g QDS\nOxycodone MR 30mg BD\n\nAllergies:\nPenicillin - rash\n\nCurrent situation:\nProgressive disease on gemcitabine/cisplatin after 4 cycles\n\nCT 10 March 2024 shows increase in primary mass to 10.2cm with new peritoneal deposits and increase in pulmonary nodules\n\nCommenced on dabrafenib/trametinib 15 March 2024\n\nPerformance status deteriorated to ECOG 2\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who attended with his wife. Unfortunately, he has experienced significant clinical deterioration since starting targeted therapy two weeks ago. His abdominal pain has worsened requiring increased opioid doses, and he now has early satiety with associated 4kg weight loss. His mobility has declined and he now requires a wheelchair for hospital visits. Examination shows increased abdominal distension with shifting dullness suggesting ascites.\n\nBloods show deteriorating liver function with bilirubin now 45, ALT 156, ALP 445. His renal function remains stable at baseline. Given his rapid clinical deterioration, I have discussed with [redacted name] and his wife that we should pause the dabrafenib/trametinib and arrange urgent drainage of ascites. I have explained that if his clinical condition stabilizes, we can consider restarting at a reduced dose, but we may need to transition to best supportive care if further deterioration occurs.\n\nI have arranged urgent paracentesis for tomorrow morning and referred to the palliative care team for review this week. We will review again in one week with repeat bloods and clinical assessment to determine next steps. I have provided emergency contact details and warned about red flag symptoms requiring urgent review.",
