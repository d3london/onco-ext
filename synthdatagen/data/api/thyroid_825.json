Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma with TERT and TP53 mutations\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2024 Total thyroidectomy with level VI neck dissection\n\tComplicated by left recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\t1 Feb - 15 Feb 2024\n\tPalliative IMRT 30Gy in 10 fractions to thyroid bed and bilateral neck\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tWeekly Paclitaxel/Carboplatin commenced 20 Feb 2024\n\tDiscontinued after cycle 3 due to disease progression\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNot eligible for current trials due to brain metastases\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease with new brain metastases and enlarging lung metastases\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Increasing dyspnoea requiring oxygen 3L/min\n\t2. Left vocal cord palsy with intermittent aspiration\n\t3. Headaches and mild confusion\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 68-year-old gentleman has unfortunately shown rapid progression of his anaplastic thyroid cancer despite initial multimodal therapy. Recent MRI brain from 15 April 2024 shows multiple new cerebral metastases with the largest measuring 2.8cm in right frontal lobe with surrounding edema. CT thorax shows enlarging bilateral pulmonary metastases with new malignant pleural effusion.\n\nHe has deteriorated significantly over the past two weeks with increasing confusion, persistent headaches, and worsening breathlessness. His performance status has declined from ECOG 1 to ECOG 3. He requires increasing oxygen support and assistance with most activities of daily living.\n\nOn examination today, he is drowsy but rousable, oriented to person only. Oxygen saturations 94% on 3L/min oxygen. Bilateral decreased air entry with dullness to percussion at both bases. Neurological examination shows new right-sided weakness grade 4/5.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tUrgent CT head arranged for tomorrow\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tDexamethasone 8mg BD commenced\n\tOndansetron 4mg TDS PRN\n\tOxycodone MR 10mg BD\n\n\tFollow up\n\tUrgent referral to local palliative care team\n\tTransfer of care to [redacted name] Hospital palliative care unit arranged\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPlease support palliative care referral\n\tPrescribe breakthrough medications as per palliative care team recommendations",
