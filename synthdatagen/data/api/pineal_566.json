MRI brain showed obstructive hydrocephalus from a 3.2cm pineal mass. Emergency endoscopic third ventriculostomy was performed with concurrent biopsy confirming pineoblastoma. Post-operative MRI shows good decompression of ventricles with residual 2.8cm enhancing pineal mass. Spine MRI and CSF cytology negative for dissemination.\n\nOn examination today, alert and oriented with resolving papilledema. No focal neurological deficits. Performance status 1.\n\nPlan for craniospinal radiotherapy 36Gy in 20 fractions with boost to primary site to 54Gy, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy as per PNET protocol. Will commence radiotherapy planning next week with aim to start treatment in 2 weeks time. Follow-up arranged in combined neuro-oncology clinic during week 1 of radiotherapy.",
