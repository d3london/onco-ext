  "content": "Diagnosis:\nClear cell carcinoma of ovary, Stage IC2 (capsule rupture during surgery)\n\nSurgery:\n15 March 2024 - Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy and peritoneal biopsies\n\nHistology:\nClear cell carcinoma of right ovary\nARID1A mutation detected\nHNF1B positive\nNo lymphovascular invasion\nNo surface involvement\nCapsule rupture during surgery\n\nPrevious medical history:\nHypertension\nType 2 diabetes\n\nCurrent medications:\nMetformin 1g BD\nRamipril 5mg OD\n\nAllergies:\nNone known\n\nCurrent situation:\nSeen for discussion regarding adjuvant chemotherapy\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following her recent surgery. She has recovered well with good wound healing and no post-operative complications. Her performance status is 0 and she has returned to most normal activities. Blood results show normal renal and liver function. CA125 has normalized to 22 (pre-operative value 156).\n\nI have discussed the role of adjuvant chemotherapy given the clear cell histology and stage IC2 disease. The plan is to proceed with 6 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy. I have explained the common and serious side effects, and provided written information. We will arrange baseline investigations including CT chest/abdomen/pelvis and echocardiogram before starting treatment.\n\nPlan to commence chemotherapy in 2 weeks pending investigation results. Will review in clinic prior to cycle 1.",
