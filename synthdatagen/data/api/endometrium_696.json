She has recovered well from her surgery and radiotherapy with no ongoing side effects. Her energy levels have improved significantly and she has returned to her usual activities. She denies any vaginal bleeding, discharge, or pelvic pain. Her appetite is good and weight stable.\n\nOn examination today, her abdomen is soft and non-tender with well-healed port sites. Vaginal examination shows good vault healing with no concerning features.\n\nI have explained that her prognosis is excellent given the early stage and favorable histology. We will arrange CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for her 6-month follow-up visit as per protocol. She understands to contact us sooner if she develops any new symptoms in the interim.",
