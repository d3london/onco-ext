Rectal adenocarcinoma with rhabdoid features and INI1 loss\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2024 Diagnostic biopsy only - deemed inoperable due to local invasion\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t1. FOLFOXIRI + Bevacizumab Jan-Mar 2024 (4 cycles)\n\t2. FOLFIRI + Pembrolizumab Mar-Apr 2024 (2 cycles)\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tNot indicated due to widespread disease\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNot eligible due to deteriorating performance status\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease with clinical deterioration\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Increasing pelvic pain\n\t2. New onset bowel obstruction\n\t3. Malignant ascites requiring drainage\n\t4. Deteriorating performance status\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who was accompanied by his wife and daughter. Unfortunately, he has experienced significant clinical deterioration over the past two weeks. His performance status has declined from ECOG 2 to 3-4, now spending most of the day in bed. He reports worsening pelvic pain despite escalating opiate analgesia, and has developed symptoms of partial bowel obstruction with intermittent vomiting.\n\nHis most recent CT scan from 1 May 2024 shows marked disease progression with increasing size of primary rectal mass now measuring 12cm (previously 8.5cm), new peritoneal deposits, and increasing volume of ascites. There is new biliary dilatation suggesting hilar lymphadenopathy. Previous molecular testing had shown INI1 loss and high PD-L1 expression (CPS 80), but unfortunately he has not responded to immunotherapy.\n\nOn examination today, he appears cachectic with marked peripheral edema. His abdomen is distended with shifting dullness indicating ascites. There is tenderness in the lower abdomen without peritonism. Digital rectal examination reveals a fixed, tender mass.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\t1. Urgent paracentesis arranged\n\t2. LFTs, U&Es, albumin requested\n\n\tMedication changes\n\t1. Increased MST to 60mg BD\n\t2. Added Cyclizine 50mg TDS\n\t3. Started Dexamethasone 4mg BD\n\n\tFollow up\n\t1. Urgent referral to palliative care team - home visit arranged for tomorrow\n\t2. Acute oncology team aware for support\n\t3. District nurses to commence daily visits\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\t1. Please support terminal care\n\t2. Anticipatory medications to be prescribed\n\t3. Consider DS1500 completion",
