She has made an excellent recovery from surgery with no ongoing complications. Her bowel function has normalized with 2-3 formed motions daily and good continence. Her surgical wounds have healed well and she reports no pain. Her appetite is good and weight stable at 72kg. She has resumed most normal activities including regular walking.\n\nOn examination today, her abdomen is soft and non-tender with well-healed laparoscopic port sites. Digital rectal examination shows a healthy anastomosis with no concerning features.\n\nWe have discussed surveillance plans. She will have a baseline CT chest/abdomen/pelvis in 3 months' time, followed by regular CEA monitoring. I will review her again in clinic with the scan results.",
