  "content": "Diagnosis:\tT2N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma of right oral tongue\n\nManagement:\t15 Mar 2024 Wide local excision and selective neck dissection\n\t\t12/4/24 Started adjuvant radiotherapy\n\nHistology:\tModerately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, 2.8cm diameter, depth of invasion 8mm, clear margins (>5mm), no lymphovascular invasion. 0/21 nodes positive.\n\nCurrent Situation:\tWeek 4 of adjuvant radiotherapy\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today during week 4 of adjuvant radiotherapy. Treatment has been well tolerated with grade 2 mucositis managed with regular analgesics and mouth care. Weight has remained stable at 72kg with dietetic support. No issues with mask fitting or positioning. Examination shows expected radiation-induced changes in oral cavity but no concerning features. Blood tests remain satisfactory.\n\nThe plan is to complete the remaining radiotherapy as scheduled. We will review again in clinic next week. I have prescribed additional oral morphine solution for breakthrough pain management.",
