Treatment has been well tolerated with only grade 1 fatigue which is improving. Recent CT shows no evidence of disease recurrence. Blood tests are satisfactory for proceeding with treatment. Performance status remains 0.\n\nThe plan is to continue with cycle 4 today and arrange follow-up CT in 3 months. Will review again before cycle 5 in 3 weeks.",
