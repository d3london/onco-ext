The treatment was generally well tolerated with only grade 1-2 fatigue and occasional nausea. CT scan on 15/8/23 shows stable disease in liver metastases and no new sites of disease. Bone scan confirms stable appearances of skeletal metastases. Performance status remains 1.\n\nSymptoms are currently well controlled on current analgesic regime. Mobility has improved with physiotherapy input and bone pain is significantly better following radiotherapy and ongoing bisphosphonates.\n\nThe plan is for regular surveillance with 3-monthly CT scans and clinic review. First follow-up arranged for November 2023 with CT scan beforehand. [redacted name] understands to contact us sooner if new symptoms develop. Written information provided regarding signs/symptoms that should prompt earlier review.",
