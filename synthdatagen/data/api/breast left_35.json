  "content": "Diagnosis:\tLeft breast cancer - Grade 1 cribriform carcinoma, pT1bN0M0 (12mm), ER strongly positive (95%), PR positive (85%), HER2 negative.\n\nDiagnosed following routine screening mammogram March 2024. Underwent wire-guided wide local excision on 15 April 2024 with good cosmetic outcome. Sentinel lymph node biopsy negative (0/2 nodes).\n\n[redacted name] is a 58-year-old lady who has made an excellent recovery from her recent breast surgery. She reports minimal post-operative pain and the wound has healed well. She has returned to her usual activities including regular swimming.\n\nOn examination today, the left breast surgical site shows neat healing with no concerns. No palpable axillary nodes. Right breast normal.\n\nI have discussed the pathology results in detail. Given the small size, node-negative status, and strongly hormone receptor positive profile, the absolute benefit of chemotherapy would be very small. I have recommended hormone therapy with an aromatase inhibitor for 5 years given her post-menopausal status. We will arrange a baseline DEXA scan.\n\nThe plan is to commence letrozole 2.5mg daily. She will be referred for adjuvant radiotherapy to the left breast. Follow-up appointment arranged for 3 months with mammogram at 1 year.",
