No new sites of disease. Previous octreotide scan from February 2024 showed high uptake in liver lesions.\n\nPathology review of liver biopsy confirms moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features. Ki67 15%. Synaptophysin and chromogranin positive.\n\nMDT Recommendations:\t1. Continue current Lanreotide 120mg q4weekly given stable disease\n\t\t2. Maintain current dose without escalation\n\t\t3. Next imaging in 3 months with CT chest/abdomen/pelvis\n\t\t4. Monthly chromogranin A monitoring to continue\n\t\t5. Re-discuss at MDT if evidence of progression",
