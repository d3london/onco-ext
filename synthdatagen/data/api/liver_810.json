He has recovered well with only mild post-embolization syndrome that resolved within 48 hours. His appetite has improved and weight is stable. Performance status remains 0. Examination shows no new concerns.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 3 TACE in 6 weeks time. We will arrange a progress MRI liver and AFP prior to next treatment. Follow up appointment has been scheduled for 4 weeks.",
