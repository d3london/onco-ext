He has recovered well with only mild post-embolization syndrome that resolved within 5 days. His right upper quadrant pain has completely settled. Appetite has returned to normal and he maintains good performance status (PS 0). Blood tests show stable liver function with albumin 38, bilirubin 15, INR 1.1. AFP has decreased from 120 to 85. Triple phase CT liver performed last week shows good TACE response with complete necrosis of the target lesion. No new lesions identified. Child-Pugh A5 status maintained. The plan is to continue surveillance with 3-monthly AFP and imaging. Next triple phase CT scheduled for July 2024. Will review in clinic with results.",
