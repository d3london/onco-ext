  "content": "Diagnosis:\tAdrenocortical carcinoma with local invasion\n\nStaging:\tT4N0M0 at diagnosis (Jan 2024)\n\nBiomarkers:\tCortisol excess syndrome, androgen elevation\n\nTreatment:\tMitotane commenced 15/2/24\n\tCurrent dose 1500mg TDS\n\nCurrent Situation:\tWeek 12 treatment review\n\n[redacted name] attended for review of mitotane therapy today. Cortisol levels have improved from >2000 to 850 nmol/L. Recent CT (04-15-2024) shows stable disease with no change in the 12.5cm right adrenal mass and stable local invasion into inferior vena cava. Performance status remains 1. Main issues are grade 2 nausea and grade 1 dizziness, managed with supportive medications. Mitotane levels are now therapeutic at 15 mg/L. Blood pressure has normalized on spironolactone 100mg BD. Latest TFTs show central hypothyroidism requiring levothyroxine adjustment.\n\nPlan is to continue current mitotane dose with weekly cortisol monitoring. Endocrine review arranged for thyroid optimization. Next oncology review in 4 weeks with repeat imaging.",
