  "content": "Diagnosis:\tAdenocarcinoma of ascending colon\n\nManagement:\t15 Jan 2024 Right hemicolectomy\n\nHistology:\tpT4aN2b (12/24 nodes positive) adenocarcinoma, KRAS G13D mutation positive\n\nCurrent Situation:\tPre cycle 8 FOLFOX\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today prior to cycle 8 FOLFOX chemotherapy. Treatment tolerance has been reasonable with cumulative peripheral neuropathy now grade 2, affecting hands more than feet. Cold sensitivity remains problematic but manageable with behavioral modifications. Oxaliplatin dose was reduced to 75% from cycle 6 due to neuropathy progression.\n\nCT scan performed last week shows stable disease with no evidence of metastatic disease. CEA has normalized at 3.2 (previously 42.5 at diagnosis). Performance status remains 1 with some fatigue but able to continue working part-time.\n\nBloods today show stable parameters with hemoglobin 108 g/L, neutrophils 2.8, platelets 156. Liver and renal function remain normal. We will proceed with cycle 8 today maintaining current dose reductions. Plan for CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after cycle 9, followed by discussion regarding duration of adjuvant therapy given cumulative toxicity. Will review in 2 weeks with blood results.",
