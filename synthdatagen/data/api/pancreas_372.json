Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell features\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\tNot suitable due to extent of disease\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t1. FOLFIRINOX 4 cycles Jan-Mar 2024\n\t2. Gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel commenced April 2024\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tEnrolled in ERBB3 inhibitor trial protocol XR-789\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tPartial response to treatment\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tFatigue grade 2\n\tPeripheral neuropathy grade 1\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tReviewed today following completion of cycle 2 gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. Recent CT shows encouraging 40% reduction in pancreatic primary mass and partial response in liver metastases. Lung nodules stable, bone metastases show sclerotic change suggesting treatment response. Tolerating current regimen better than FOLFIRINOX which was stopped due to grade 3 neutropenia and grade 3 diarrhea requiring hospitalization.\n\nMolecular results confirm ERBB3 mutation making patient eligible for Phase II trial. After detailed discussion of trial protocol and standard treatment options, patient wishes to proceed with trial participation.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tBaseline trial CT and MRI scheduled for 15 May 2024\n\tECG and ECHO booked for trial screening\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tContinue supportive medications including dexamethasone 4mg daily\n\n\tFollow up\n\tTrial screening visit 12 May 2024\nTrial commencement planned for 22 May 2024\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly FBC, U&E, LFT monitoring during trial treatment\nPlease refer urgently if fever or new symptoms",
