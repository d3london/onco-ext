Unfortunately she has experienced worsening headaches and right-sided weakness over the past week despite completing gamma knife radiotherapy to the right parietal metastasis on 15/4/24. Her performance status has declined to ECOG 2, requiring assistance with daily activities. Examination shows new right-sided facial droop and 4/5 power in the right arm.\n\nUrgent MRI brain yesterday shows increased perilesional edema around the treated metastasis, measuring 3.2 x 2.8cm with significant mass effect. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis shows no other sites of disease.\n\nI have discussed the case with [redacted name] from neurosurgery who recommends urgent dexamethasone. We will discontinue trastuzumab maintenance and commence on capecitabine/lapatinib combination. I have prescribed dexamethasone 8mg BD with PPI cover and arranged urgent neurosurgery review next week. She will return to clinic in 2 weeks for assessment of response to steroids and initiation of capecitabine/lapatinib if appropriate.",
