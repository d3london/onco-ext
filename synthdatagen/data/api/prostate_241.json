  "content": "Diagnosis:\tProstate cancer - pleomorphic carcinoma, T3aN0M0\n\nInitially diagnosed March 2024 with PSA 34.5, AR-low status confirmed on molecular testing. CT and bone scan showed no evidence of metastatic disease.\n\n[redacted name] was discussed at today's Uro-oncology MDT following completion of his initial staging investigations. The case was presented by [redacted name] with full radiological review by [redacted name]. The MRI shows a 4.2cm lesion in the right peripheral zone with extracapsular extension but no seminal vesicle invasion (PI-RADS 5). Prostate biopsy from 15/3/24 confirms pleomorphic carcinoma with unusual morphological features. The pathology has been reviewed by [redacted name] who notes high-grade features with pleomorphic giant cells and extensive necrosis. Immunohistochemistry shows low androgen receptor expression.\n\nGiven the aggressive histological features and relatively high initial PSA, despite the absence of metastatic disease, there was extensive discussion about optimal management strategy. The consensus recommendation, taking into account his excellent performance status and the absence of significant comorbidities, is to proceed with multimodal therapy.\n\nThe MDT recommends combination treatment with external beam radiotherapy to the prostate (74Gy in 37 fractions) along with 2 years of androgen deprivation therapy. Given the unusual histological features, we would recommend 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy to be delivered prior to radiotherapy.\n\nI have discussed these recommendations in detail with [redacted name] and his wife following the MDT. He understands the rationale for intensive combination treatment given the high-risk features of his disease. We have covered the expected side effects of hormone therapy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, including risks of fatigue, hot flushes, potential impact on sexual function, and bone health considerations.\n\nHe will commence androgen deprivation therapy today with leuprorelin 3-monthly depot injection. I have arranged for him to see [redacted name] in the chemotherapy assessment clinic next week to begin docetaxel. He will then be reviewed in the radiotherapy planning clinic after completing chemotherapy to arrange definitive radiotherapy.",
