Treatment has been generally well-tolerated apart from thyroid dysfunction. TSH now suppressed at <0.01 with elevated free T4 at 28, consistent with thyroiditis. Started on propranolol 40mg bd for associated tachycardia. Otherwise maintaining excellent performance status with no other immune-related adverse events. Latest chest x-ray and biochemistry show no evidence of disease recurrence.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tRepeat TFTs in 1 week\n\tRoutine surveillance CT chest/abdomen/pelvis in 6 weeks\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tPropranolol 40mg bd\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up in 3 weeks pre-cycle 5\n\tEndocrinology review arranged for thyroid management\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly TFT monitoring\n\tAlert if grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events develop",
