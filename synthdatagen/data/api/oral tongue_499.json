He has made an excellent recovery following completion of adjuvant radiotherapy 6 weeks ago. His speech is now clear and easily understood. Swallowing has improved significantly with only occasional difficulty with dry foods. He maintains good oral intake and stable weight. He has returned to work part-time as an accountant.\n\nOn examination today, the surgical site shows good healing with no concerning features. No palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. The rest of the oral cavity appears healthy.\n\nI have arranged routine follow-up in 3 months with surveillance imaging at 6 months as per protocol. He understands to contact us sooner if any new concerns develop.",
