She has recovered well from both surgery and RAI treatment. Her voice has returned to normal and she reports no swallowing difficulties. Neck examination shows well-healed thyroidectomy scar with no palpable masses. TSH is appropriately suppressed at <0.1 on Levothyroxine 150mcg daily. Thyroglobulin has fallen from 45 to 2.3. Calcium and PTH levels are normal. She will continue on current Levothyroxine dose with TSH monitoring. Follow-up whole body scan and thyroglobulin measurement planned for 6 months. Next clinic review in 3 months with blood tests.",
