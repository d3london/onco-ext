  "content": "Diagnosis\n\t1. Squamous cell carcinoma right lower lobe lung with bone and liver metastases\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\tNot indicated\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\t15 Feb 2024 - Palliative radiotherapy to T8 vertebral metastasis (20Gy/5#)\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tCarboplatin/Pembrolizumab commenced 01 Feb 2024\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tMixed response - improving bone pain but new liver lesions\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tFatigue, reduced mobility, liver function derangement\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 64-year-old gentleman was reviewed today in clinic. Recent CT imaging from 15 April 2024 shows mixed response with stable bone metastases but progression in liver with two new lesions in segments 6 and 7 measuring 2.1cm and 1.8cm respectively. His main symptoms are worsening fatigue and right upper quadrant discomfort. His mobility has declined, now requiring a walking frame. Liver function tests show new derangement with ALT 156, ALP 345.\n\nPerformance status has declined to ECOG 2. On examination, there is tender hepatomegaly extending 4cm below costal margin. Chest examination reveals reduced air entry at right base but no added sounds.\n\nGiven progression on first-line therapy, we have discussed second-line treatment options. In view of FGFR amplification status, we will commence Erdafitinib. I have explained the monitoring requirements including phosphate levels and ophthalmology review.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tBaseline ophthalmology assessment\nRepeat CT in 8 weeks\nWeekly phosphate monitoring\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tErdafitinib 8mg daily\nParacetamol 1g QDS\nOxycodone MR 20mg BD\n\n\tFollow up\n\tWeekly review for first month of Erdafitinib\nNext oncology follow up in 1 week\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly blood tests including phosphate\nPlease monitor liver function\nReferral to community physiotherapy requested",
