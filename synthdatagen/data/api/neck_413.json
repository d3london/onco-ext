Merkel cell carcinoma of right neck, MCPyV negative, PD-L1 high expression\n\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2024 Wide local excision and modified neck dissection\n\n\tSystemic therapy\n\t1. First-line Avelumab commenced February 2024\n\t2. Disease progression after 3 cycles\n\t3. Second-line chemotherapy with carboplatin/etoposide commenced April 2024\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease with deteriorating clinical status\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Worsening liver function\n\t2. Increasing dyspnoea\n\t3. Fatigue and reduced mobility\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 72-year-old gentleman attended clinic today with his wife for urgent review due to clinical deterioration. He has unfortunately shown rapid disease progression despite second-line chemotherapy, with new and enlarging liver metastases causing derangement of liver function. His most recent CT on 15/5/24 showed multiple new liver lesions, largest measuring 8.2cm, and progression of pulmonary metastases with new pleural effusions.\n\nHe reports worsening breathlessness, now occurring at rest, and increasing right upper quadrant discomfort. His mobility has significantly declined, now spending approximately 70% of the day in bed or chair (PS 3). Examination shows reduced air entry at both bases, tender hepatomegaly extending 6cm below costal margin, and peripheral edema to mid-calf.\n\nLiver function tests show rising bilirubin at 45 μmol/L, ALT 156, ALP 345. His albumin has dropped to 28 g/L.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tUrgent pleural aspiration being arranged\n\n\tMedication changes\n\t1. Commenced dexamethasone 4mg bd\n\t2. Increased opioid to MST 30mg bd\n\t3. Added spironolactone 100mg od\n\n\tFollow up\n\t1. Urgent referral to palliative care team - home visit arranged for tomorrow\n\t2. Acute oncology review in one week\n\t3. District nurse referral completed\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\t1. Please monitor liver function weekly\n\t2. Consider increasing diuretics if peripheral edema worsens\n\t3. Anticipatory medications to be prescribed",
