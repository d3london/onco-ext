Initial grade 2 dizziness has improved with dose reduction to 400mg daily from cycle 4. Performance status remains 1. Weight has stabilized at 72kg. Latest blood tests show stable liver function and normal renal function. CEA and CA19-9 continue to trend downward, correlating with radiological stability. Examination shows no new concerns. The plan is to continue with cycle 7 today and arrange repeat imaging after cycle 9. All questions addressed and [redacted name] understands to contact us if any problems develop.",
