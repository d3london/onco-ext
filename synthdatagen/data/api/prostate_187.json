  "content": "I reviewed [redacted name] today who has unfortunately shown clear evidence of disease progression on his current treatment regimen. He was initially diagnosed with ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate in January 2024, presenting with widespread bone metastases and an initial PSA of 445. His disease was noted to be MMR-deficient on initial molecular profiling. He commenced ADT with Leuprorelin and received emergency radiotherapy to T7 for cord compression. His PSA initially responded well, falling to 89 by February 2024, and he was started on Docetaxel chemotherapy.\n\nUnfortunately, during cycle 4 of Docetaxel in March 2024, he developed new headaches and ataxia. An urgent MRI brain revealed three metastatic deposits in the right cerebellum and left frontal lobe, the largest measuring 2.8cm with associated edema. He received urgent whole brain radiotherapy (20Gy in 5 fractions) with good symptomatic improvement. His chemotherapy was suspended during radiotherapy.\n\nAt today's review, his performance status has declined to ECOG 2-3, spending more than 50% of the day in bed. He describes worsening bone pain despite optimal analgesia (currently on Morphine SR 60mg BD and Pregabalin 150mg BD). His latest PSA has risen significantly to 678. He has developed grade 2 peripheral neuropathy from his previous Docetaxel. Recent CT shows progressive bone disease with new vertebral deposits at T4 and L2, though no visceral disease.\n\nGiven his MMR-deficient status and clear progression on first-line treatment, I have discussed with [redacted name] the rationale for switching to Pembrolizumab immunotherapy. We reviewed the side effect profile in detail, particularly the risk of immune-related adverse events. He understands the need for prompt reporting of new symptoms. I have arranged for him to start treatment next week, with close monitoring of his neurological symptoms given his brain metastases.\n\nHe will require a repeat MRI brain in 6 weeks to assess intracranial disease response. We have also referred him to the palliative care team for optimization of his bone pain management. His next oncology review will be in 2 weeks' time, prior to cycle 2 of immunotherapy. Blood tests including thyroid function, cortisol, and inflammatory markers will be checked prior to each cycle.",
