  "content": "Diagnosis:\tLeft breast secretory carcinoma\n\nManagement:\t12 Apr 2024 Wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy\n\nHistology:\tSecretory carcinoma, 0.8mm focus, grade 2\n\tER/PR/HER2 negative\n\tNTRK fusion positive\n\tSentinel nodes negative (0/2)\n\tStage pT1miN0M0\n\nCurrent Situation:\tPost-operative review\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following her recent breast surgery. The surgical wounds are healing well with no evidence of infection or seroma. She has good arm movement and no concerning symptoms. Given the sub-millimeter size, node-negative status, and clear margins, the risk of recurrence is considered very low. The presence of NTRK fusion has been confirmed on molecular testing, though given the extremely small tumor size, targeted therapy is not indicated at this stage. We have discussed surveillance plans, including annual mammography. She will be reviewed in the breast clinic in 3 months' time with repeat imaging. She understands to contact us sooner if she develops any new symptoms or concerns.",
