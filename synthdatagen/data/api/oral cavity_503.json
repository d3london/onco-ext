Pembrolizumab-Cisplatin-5FU combination - 2 cycles completed\n\t2. Treatment discontinued due to clinical deterioration\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tNot delivered due to clinical deterioration\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease with new pulmonary metastases and local progression\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Severe oral pain\n\t2. Progressive dysphagia\n\t3. Weight loss\n\t4. Increasing oxygen requirements\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 68-year-old gentleman was reviewed today in clinic with his daughter. Unfortunately, he has experienced significant clinical deterioration over the past three weeks. His oral intake has reduced substantially due to progressive dysphagia and severe oral pain, now requiring liquid nutritional supplements. He has lost a further 4kg since last review, bringing total weight loss to 12kg over 3 months.\n\nHis performance status has declined from ECOG 1 to ECOG 3, now spending most of the day in bed or chair. He requires 3L/min oxygen via nasal cannulae for new onset breathlessness. Recent CT chest (15 April 2024) shows multiple new bilateral pulmonary metastases and enlargement of primary tumor from 4.2cm to 5.8cm despite two cycles of systemic therapy.\n\nOn examination today, there is extension of the primary tumor with new involvement of the anterior tongue. Bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy is unchanged. Chest examination reveals reduced air entry bilaterally with fine crackles at both bases.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tUrgent CT head requested to investigate new onset headaches\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\t1. Oxycodone modified release increased to 40mg BD\n\t2. Breakthrough oxycodone 10mg/4hrly PRN\n\t3. Regular dexamethasone 4mg BD\n\n\tFollow up\n\t1. Urgent palliative care review arranged for tomorrow\n\t2. Weekly oncology review\n\t3. Referral to hospital nutrition team completed\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\t1. Please monitor renal function weekly\n\t2. Consider home oxygen assessment\n\t3. District nurse referral for support with medications",
