  "content": "Diagnosis:\nMicrocystic serous carcinoma of pancreatic tail, T2N1M0\n\nSurgery:\nDistal pancreatectomy and splenectomy performed 15 Jan 2024 by [redacted name]\n\nHistology:\nMicrocystic serous carcinoma, 3.8cm, clear margins (R0)\nTwo positive peripancreatic lymph nodes from 14 sampled\nVHL mutation detected\n\nTreatment completed:\n6 cycles adjuvant gemcitabine completed 20 April 2024\n\nCurrent situation:\nEnd of treatment assessment\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. She has tolerated the treatment well with only grade 1 fatigue and mild nausea. Her post-operative recovery was uncomplicated and she has now returned to her baseline level of function. Performance status is 0. Weight has remained stable at 68kg. Examination shows well-healed surgical scars with no concerning features.\n\nPost-treatment CT scan on 25 April 2024 shows no evidence of disease recurrence. Blood tests including liver function and amylase are within normal range.\n\nThe plan is for surveillance with 3-monthly clinic review and alternating CT chest/abdomen/pelvis scans. Next clinic appointment will be in July 2024 with CT scan beforehand. I have provided written information about surveillance protocol and symptoms that should prompt earlier review.",
