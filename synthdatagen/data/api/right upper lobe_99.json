  "content": "Diagnosis:\tStage I (T1bN0M0) EGFR-mutant adenocarcinoma right upper lobe\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] in follow-up clinic today. She completed radical radiotherapy (55Gy in 20 fractions) to the right upper lobe primary in January 2024, having declined surgery. She has been on Osimertinib 80mg daily since February 2024 following detection of an EGFR L858R mutation.\n\nShe reports feeling well with stable breathing and no new symptoms. Her exercise tolerance remains good, managing daily 30-minute walks. Performance status remains 0.\n\nCT thorax performed last week shows stable appearances of the treated right upper lobe primary lesion measuring 2.1cm (previously 2.2cm). No evidence of nodal or distant disease.\n\nBlood tests show stable biochemistry and full blood count. Her latest CEA is 3.2 (previously 3.5).\n\nThe plan is to continue Osimertinib at current dose with next CT scan in 3 months. We will review her again following those results.",
