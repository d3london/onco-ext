  "content": "Diagnosis\n\t1. Bilateral breast adenocarcinoma with miliary metastatic disease\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\tNot appropriate due to extent of disease\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t1. Jan-Mar 2024: Weekly Paclitaxel with Trastuzumab\n\t2. Mar-Apr 2024: Trastuzumab-Deruxtecan (T-DXd)\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNGS panel identified HER2 G776delinsVC mutation\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease with deteriorating clinical status\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Progressive dyspnoea requiring oxygen therapy\n\t2. Increasing fatigue and reduced mobility\n\t3. Poor oral intake\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who attended with her daughter. Unfortunately, her condition has significantly deteriorated over the past two weeks. The miliary metastatic disease in her lungs has progressed despite two cycles of T-DXd, with increasing oxygen requirements now at 4L/min at rest. Her mobility has declined significantly, and she now requires assistance with most activities of daily living. Her appetite remains poor despite antiemetics and steroids.\n\nCT chest performed yesterday shows progression of diffuse miliary metastases throughout both lung fields with new small pleural effusions bilaterally. There is also progression of liver metastases with largest lesion now measuring 4.8cm (previously 3.2cm).\n\nOn examination today, she appears notably more fatigued with respiratory rate of 24/min. Oxygen saturations 92% on 4L/min. There are widespread fine crackles throughout both lung fields. Performance status has declined to ECOG 3.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tNone currently appropriate\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\t1. Dexamethasone 4mg bd\n\t2. Oxycodone MR 10mg bd\n\t3. Metoclopramide 10mg tds\n\n\tFollow up\n\t1. Urgent referral to palliative care team - completed today\n\t2. Community nursing team referral - completed today\n\t3. Oncology review in 1 week or sooner if needed\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\t1. Please prescribe oxygen concentrator for home use\n\t2. Consider increased package of care\n\t3. Please monitor for need for breakthrough medications\n\n\tSummary of information given to patient\n\tDetailed discussion held regarding disease progression and changing focus of care to symptom management. [redacted name] and family understand that prognosis is now limited to weeks.",
