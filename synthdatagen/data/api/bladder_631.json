  "content": "Many thanks for referring [redacted name] who I reviewed today with his wife and daughter present. He has unfortunately shown clear evidence of disease progression despite second-line treatment.\n\nTo recap, [redacted name] was diagnosed with plasmacytoid variant urothelial carcinoma of the bladder in September 2023, initially presenting with haematuria and lower back pain. Initial staging demonstrated widespread metastatic disease affecting multiple vertebrae (T4, T7, T12) and bilobar liver involvement. HER2 testing showed low expression (IHC 2+). He completed 4 cycles of Gemcitabine/Cisplatin between October-December 2023 with initial partial response, but developed progressive disease in January 2024 with new liver lesions and increasing bone pain.\n\nHe commenced second-line treatment with Enfortumab Vedotin in February 2024. Unfortunately, after 2 cycles, his most recent CT scan from 15 April 2024 shows clear disease progression with 30% increase in liver metastases and new bone lesions in the right acetabulum and left femoral neck. His performance status has declined from ECOG 1 to ECOG 3, now spending most of the day in bed due to fatigue and bone pain. He requires increasing doses of opiates, currently on MST 60mg BD and Oxycodone breakthrough, with associated constipation requiring regular laxatives.\n\nOn examination today, he appears cachectic with marked muscle wasting. There is significant tenderness over the right hip and lumbar spine. Liver span is increased to 16cm with irregular edge. Blood tests show deteriorating liver function with bilirubin 45, ALT 156, ALP 445. His eGFR has dropped to 38 from 55 last month.\n\nI have had a detailed discussion with [redacted name] and his family about the clear evidence of disease progression and poor prognosis. Given his declining performance status and organ function, I do not feel further systemic anti-cancer therapy would be appropriate or safe. We have agreed to focus on symptom control and quality of life.\n\nI have referred urgently to palliative care for review of pain control and other symptom management. I have arranged urgent radiotherapy assessment for possible palliative radiotherapy to symptomatic bone sites. The acute oncology team will assist with community support setup. We will continue to provide support through our nurse specialist team who will maintain regular telephone contact. I have given clear instructions about red flag symptoms requiring urgent medical attention.\n\nWe will review him again in 2 weeks' time, sooner if needed. I have explained that we can bring this appointment forward if there are any concerns in the meantime.",
