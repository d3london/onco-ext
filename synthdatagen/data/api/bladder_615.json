She has made an excellent recovery from surgery with no immediate post-operative complications. Her renal function remains stable with creatinine 98. She is managing her stoma independently and has returned to most normal activities. Her wound has healed well with no evidence of infection. Performance status is 0.\n\nThe final histology shows complete pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with no residual cancer identified in the cystectomy specimen. This represents an excellent outcome. We have discussed the surveillance plan, which will involve 3-monthly clinical reviews for the first year with CT chest/abdomen/pelvis every 6 months. First surveillance scan arranged for October 2024. She will continue under regular stoma nurse review.",
