She reports mild fatigue but maintains good oral intake and regular walking. Performance status remains 0. Blood results show stable renal function and acceptable haematological parameters for cycle 2 cisplatin next week. Examination shows expected radiation changes but no concerning features.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 2 cisplatin on 15/4/24 and continue radiation as planned. We will review again in 2 weeks with blood tests.",
