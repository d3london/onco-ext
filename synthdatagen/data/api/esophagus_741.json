Treatment has been well tolerated with grade 1 esophagitis managed with regular analgesia. Recent CT shows excellent partial response with >50% reduction in primary tumor and resolution of previously involved nodes. Performance status remains 1. Blood parameters are satisfactory for proceeding with final cycle. Weight has stabilized at 72kg. Radiotherapy completed 2 weeks ago with good tolerance. Plan to proceed with cycle 4 today and arrange follow-up CT chest/abdomen at 4 weeks post completion of treatment.",
