  "content": "Diagnosis:\nDesmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma (WHO grade I)\nBRAF wildtype\nRight temporal lobe lesion diagnosed March 2024\n\nPrevious medical history:\nFebrile seizures age 2\nNo other significant history\n\nCurrent medications:\nLevetiracetam 250mg twice daily\n\nAllergies:\nNone known\n\nCurrent situation:\nPost-operative following gross total resection on 15 April 2024\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today accompanied by both parents following recent neurosurgery. The 4-year-old has made an excellent recovery from surgery with no neurological deficits. The post-operative MRI shows complete resection of the right temporal lesion with expected post-surgical changes. Histology confirms WHO grade I desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma, BRAF wildtype status.\n\nShe is tolerating the anti-epileptic medication well with no further seizures since surgery. Her speech, mobility, and behavior are all age-appropriate. Parents report good appetite and normal sleep pattern.\n\nGiven the complete resection and favorable histology, we will proceed with surveillance only. I have arranged an MRI brain in 3 months' time. We will see her back in clinic following this scan. The family understands to contact us sooner if there are any concerns.",
