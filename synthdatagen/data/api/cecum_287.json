  "content": "Diagnosis:\tCecal adenocarcinoma, pT2N0M0, poorly differentiated, MSS, BRAF V600E mutant\n\nDiagnosed following investigation of iron deficiency anaemia. Colonoscopy on 15 March 2024 identified a 4cm cecal mass. CT staging showed no evidence of metastatic disease. [redacted name] underwent right hemicolectomy on 2 April 2024 performed by [redacted name].\n\nHistology confirms a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, pT2N0 (0/15 nodes), margins clear. Molecular testing shows microsatellite stable (MSS) status and BRAF V600E mutation. No lymphovascular invasion identified.\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following her recent surgery. She has recovered well with no post-operative complications. Her bowel function has normalized and she is managing a regular diet. Performance status is 0. Examination shows well-healed laparoscopic port sites.\n\nGiven the stage and high-risk features (poorly differentiated histology, BRAF mutation), I have recommended 3 months of adjuvant CAPOX chemotherapy. [redacted name] understands the aims of treatment and potential side effects. We will arrange baseline blood tests and proceed with cycle 1 next week. Follow-up CT scan will be arranged for 3 months' time.",
