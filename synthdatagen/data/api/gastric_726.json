He is now 12 weeks post-gastrectomy and making good progress with recovery. His weight has stabilized at 72kg with appropriate nutritional supplementation and dietary modifications. He is managing 5-6 small meals per day with minimal dumping symptoms. Performance status has improved to PS 0. Blood tests show stable parameters with appropriate B12 levels on replacement. No concerning features on examination today. The plan is to continue current management and arrange surveillance CT in 3 months' time. We will review him again following the scan.",
