Initial imaging revealed a 12cm right lobe mass with invasion of the right portal vein. AFP is markedly elevated at 25,000 kU/L with PIVKA-II also raised. Liver biopsy on 15/2/24 confirmed moderately differentiated HCC.\n\nHe has been screened for the STELLAR-301 trial comparing durvalumab + tremelimumab versus sorafenib. All eligibility criteria have been met including adequate organ function, Child-Pugh A status, and no contraindications to immunotherapy. The trial protocol, including randomisation, treatment schedule, and monitoring requirements has been discussed in detail. Written informed consent has been obtained.\n\nOn examination today, he has mild right upper quadrant tenderness but no ascites. ECOG performance status is 1. Latest bloods show stable liver function with albumin 38, bilirubin 28, PT 14 seconds.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tBaseline CT chest/abdomen/pelvis and MRI liver scheduled for 22/3/24\nBaseline ECG and echocardiogram completed today\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tPrescribed trial medication as per protocol\nContinuing propranolol 40mg BD for portal hypertension\n\n\tFollow up\n\tTrial treatment to commence 25/3/24\nWeekly review for first 4 weeks then 2-weekly as per protocol\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly blood tests as per trial protocol - forms provided\nUrgent contact if any immune-related symptoms develop",
