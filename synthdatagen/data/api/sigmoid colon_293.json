The previous cycles have been well tolerated with only grade 1 diarrhea managed with loperamide. The acneiform rash is improving with topical antibiotics. His appetite has improved significantly and weight has stabilized at 72kg. Oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy is gradually improving since switching regimens.\n\nExamination shows improving abdominal distension. Stoma is healthy and functioning well. Blood results are satisfactory for proceeding with treatment.\n\nThe plan is to continue with cycle 3 today. We will arrange CT assessment after cycle 4. Follow-up appointment in 2 weeks with blood tests. [redacted name] understands to contact us if any problems develop.",
