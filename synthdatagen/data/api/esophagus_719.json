She is tolerating the adjuvant trastuzumab/pertuzumab well with no cardiac symptoms and good exercise tolerance. Recent cardiac echo shows preserved ejection fraction at 58%. She reports mild fatigue but is otherwise maintaining normal activities. No dysphagia or other GI symptoms. Latest bloods show stable parameters.?\n\nPlan is to continue with cycle 4 next week. Will arrange surveillance endoscopy for 3 months' time and see her again with those results.?",
