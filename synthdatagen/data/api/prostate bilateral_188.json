High-risk disease with nodal involvement\n\t2. Good performance status, no significant comorbidities\n\t3. Patient preference for radical treatment\n\nMDT Outcome:\tRecommendation for combination therapy:\n\t1. Androgen deprivation therapy for 2 years\n\t2. Radical radiotherapy to prostate and pelvic nodes\n\t3. Consider docetaxel chemotherapy\n\nCurrent Status:\tStarted Leuprorelin 3-monthly depot 11.25mg on 27/03/24\n\tPSA reduced to 28.4 (05/04/24)\n\tTolerating hormonal therapy with mild hot flushes\n\nPlan:\tReview in combined clinic with Clinical Oncology in 2 weeks\n\tDiscuss timing of radiotherapy and role of docetaxel",
