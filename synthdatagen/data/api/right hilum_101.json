Recent CT shows mixed response with reduction in liver metastases but new T8 vertebral lesion causing pain. Performance status remains 2. Managing current chemotherapy with grade 2 fatigue and grade 1 thrombocytopenia. Requires regular oxycodone for bone pain which has increased over past week. Blood results show platelets 89, hemoglobin 98, neutrophils 1.8 - acceptable for treatment continuation. Have arranged urgent MRI spine and referral to clinical oncology for consideration of palliative radiotherapy to T8. Will proceed with cycle 3 Topotecan today at current dose. Review in 2 weeks with blood results and after MRI.",
