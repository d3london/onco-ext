Underwent robotic prostatectomy in May 2023.\n\n[redacted name] attended for routine follow-up today. He has made an excellent recovery from his surgery with good urinary continence and no significant ongoing side effects. His latest PSA is <0.01ng/ml, maintaining his excellent biochemical response. He reports good energy levels and has returned to his usual activities including golf twice weekly. No concerning symptoms reported.\n\nClinical examination today was unremarkable. His next PSA check is due in 3 months' time and we will see him back in clinic in 6 months with those results. I have explained that his outlook remains very favorable given his excellent post-operative response.",
