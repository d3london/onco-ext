She has tolerated the treatment well with only grade 1 palmar-plantar syndrome which has now resolved. Her liver function tests have normalized and recent CT imaging on 15/4/24 shows no evidence of disease recurrence. Performance status remains 0 and she has returned to work full-time. Clinical examination today was unremarkable with well-healed surgical scars.\n\nThe plan is to continue with 3-monthly surveillance imaging for the first year. I have arranged a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for July 2024 and will review her with the results. Blood tests including LFTs and CA19-9 will be monitored monthly via the GP.",
