  "content": "Diagnosis:\nMetastatic prostate adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation\n\nInitial Presentation:\nDiagnosed January 2024 with PSA 542, Gleason 4+5=9\nBone scan and CT 15.01.24 showing widespread bone metastases\n\nPrevious Treatment:\nAndrogen deprivation therapy commenced 20.01.24\nDocetaxel chemotherapy initiated February 2024 - completed 3 cycles\n\nPrevious medical history:\nType 2 diabetes\nHypertension\nPrevious DVT 2020\n\nCurrent medications:\nLeuprorelin 3-monthly\nDexamethasone 0.5mg bd\nApixaban for DVT prophylaxis\nMetformin\nRamipril\n\nCurrent situation:\nProgressive disease with rising PSA (now 890) and new bone pain\nRapidly rising chromogranin A and NSE suggesting neuroendocrine transformation\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who has unfortunately shown evidence of disease progression despite initial docetaxel chemotherapy. His PSA has risen from 320 to 890 over the past 4 weeks, with concurrent significant elevation in neuroendocrine markers (Chromogranin A >1000, NSE 280). He describes worsening bone pain affecting his thoracic spine and right hip, requiring increased analgesia. His mobility has declined and he now requires a walking frame. Performance status has deteriorated to ECOG 2.\n\nExamination shows marked tenderness over T8 vertebra and right hip. Neurological examination remains intact with no evidence of cord compression.\n\nGiven the evidence of neuroendocrine transformation and rapid clinical deterioration, I have discussed changing treatment to carboplatin/etoposide chemotherapy. [redacted name] understands this represents a significant change in treatment approach but wishes to proceed given his symptomatic decline. We have discussed the aims of treatment and potential side effects in detail.\n\nPlan:\n1. Commence carboplatin AUC 5 / etoposide 100mg/m2 regime\n2. Urgent MRI spine to exclude cord compression\n3. Referral to palliative care team for pain management\n4. Continue leuprorelin and dexamethasone\n5. Review in 2 weeks with blood results prior to cycle 2",
