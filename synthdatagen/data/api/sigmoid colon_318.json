  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMetastatic sigmoid adenocarcinoma with choriocarcinomatous differentiation\n\nManagement:\t15 Jan 2024 Sigmoid colectomy\n\t\t12 Feb 2024 Started FOLFOX chemotherapy\n\t\t20 Mar 2024 Commenced Phase II trial of anti-HCG monoclonal antibody\n\nHistology:\tpT3N1 adenocarcinoma with choriocarcinomatous features, β-HCG immunohistochemistry strongly positive\n\nCurrent Situation:\tTrial screening visit completed\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of trial screening investigations. His metastatic sigmoid cancer with unusual choriocarcinomatous differentiation has shown partial response to initial FOLFOX chemotherapy, with CT showing 30% reduction in liver metastases and falling β-HCG levels from 12,500 to 4,200 IU/L. Performance status remains 1. He has completed all trial eligibility assessments including cardiac echo (normal), baseline CT, and required blood work. Trial consent has been obtained and documented. He meets all inclusion criteria with no exclusions identified.\n\nThe trial protocol involves anti-HCG monoclonal antibody administered every 2 weeks with continuation of modified FOLFOX. I have explained the requirement for weekly β-HCG measurements and 6-weekly CT assessments. He understands the potential side effects and requirement to report all symptoms promptly. Trial medication will commence next week following final pharmacy verification. We will review him weekly for the first month then every 2 weeks. Next appointment scheduled for trial drug administration on 27th March.",
