She has recovered well from the procedure with no significant side effects. Mild temporary taste disturbance has now completely resolved. She reports good energy levels on current thyroid replacement dose.\n\nThyroglobulin level is appropriately suppressed at <0.1 ng/ml. TSH remains well controlled at 0.05 mU/L indicating adequate suppression. Neck examination shows well-healed thyroidectomy scar with no concerning features.\n\nPost-ablation scan shows no evidence of residual thyroid tissue or metastatic disease. The treatment has been successful with good uptake in thyroid bed.\n\nPlan:\nContinue current levothyroxine dose\nRepeat thyroglobulin and TSH in 3 months\nSurveillance neck ultrasound in 6 months\nFollow up appointment in 3 months with blood results",
