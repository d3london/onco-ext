Prostate adenocarcinoma T3b N0 M0\n\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tMarch 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tCurative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\tNone\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tNot yet commenced\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tNot indicated\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tPRECISION-RT trial registration completed today\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tLocally advanced disease, no metastases\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tNocturia x3, mild urinary frequency\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\t[redacted name] attended today for trial registration. Initial prostate biopsy on 15/03/24 showed Gleason 4+4=8 adenocarcinoma involving right base and mid-gland with extracapsular extension. Initial PSA was 28.6. Staging investigations including bone scan 28/03/24 and MRI pelvis 25/03/24 confirm T3b disease with right seminal vesicle involvement but no evidence of metastatic disease.\n\nMolecular testing has identified a pathogenic FANCA mutation which makes him eligible for the PRECISION-RT trial investigating targeted radiotherapy intensification. I have completed a detailed discussion of the trial protocol, including randomisation between standard and intensified radiotherapy doses, additional imaging requirements, and potential side effects. He understands the additional hospital visits required for the research assessments.\n\nHe has commenced on Goserelin 10.8mg 12-weekly with first injection given 02/04/24. Trial-mandated baseline assessments including International Prostate Symptom Score, quality of life questionnaires, and PSA have been completed today. Latest PSA has improved to 18.2.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tTrial-mandated CT planning scan booked for 25/04/24\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tGoserelin 10.8mg 12-weekly, next dose due 25/06/24\n\n\tFollow up\n\tTrial baseline MRI 18/04/24\nRandomisation clinic 02/05/24\nRadiotherapy planned to commence mid-May\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tMonthly PSA measurements as per trial protocol\nPlease monitor renal function during hormone therapy",
