  "content": "Many thanks for referring [redacted name] for MDT discussion following completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for limited stage small cell lung cancer of the right lung. The patient completed 4 cycles of carboplatin/etoposide with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (45Gy in 30 fractions) on 15 March 2024, having commenced treatment in January 2024 following diagnosis via bronchoscopic biopsy. Molecular testing confirmed MYCN amplification.\n\nThe case was discussed at today's Lung MDT with review of the recent post-treatment CT chest/abdomen/pelvis from 12 April 2024. This shows excellent partial response with reduction in the right hilar mass from 4.8cm to 1.2cm and resolution of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. No evidence of distant metastatic disease.\n\nThe patient has recovered well from chemoradiotherapy with improving energy levels and resolution of initial presenting cough. Grade 2 radiation esophagitis has now settled. Blood tests show stable FBC and biochemistry.\n\nThe MDT recommendations are to proceed with prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) given the good response to initial treatment. This has been scheduled to commence on 22 April 2024. Following PCI completion, surveillance imaging will be arranged for 3 months' time with clinical review in the Thursday lung oncology clinic. The patient has been provided with written information about PCI and will be reviewed by clinical oncology prior to treatment start.",
