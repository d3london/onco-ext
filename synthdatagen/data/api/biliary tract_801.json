  "content": "Diagnosis:\n\nCholangiocarcinoma with widespread metastatic disease\n\nDisease Background:\nInitially diagnosed January 2024 with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. IDH1 wild-type on molecular testing. Multiple liver metastases and bone metastases at presentation.\n\nTreatment History:\nCycle 1-3 Cisplatin/Gemcitabine completed March 2024\nPalliative radiotherapy to T8 vertebra March 2024\nCycle 4 chemotherapy omitted due to clinical deterioration\n\nCurrent Situation:\nSignificant clinical deterioration over past 3 weeks\n\nSymptom Assessment:\nWorsening right upper quadrant pain requiring increased opiate doses\nNew onset confusion and drowsiness\nProgressive fatigue limiting mobility\nPoor oral intake with 4kg weight loss in 2 weeks\n\nClinical Findings:\nPerformance status deteriorated to ECOG 3\nJaundiced with tender hepatomegaly\nMild asterixis noted\nConfused with fluctuating consciousness\n\nRecent Investigations:\nCT 15 April 2024 shows marked progression of liver disease with new biliary obstruction\nBilirubin 250, ALT 456, ALP 789\n\nDiscussion with [redacted name] and family:\nI had a lengthy discussion with [redacted name] and her daughter today regarding the significant deterioration in her condition. We discussed that her cancer is unfortunately progressing despite initial chemotherapy, with new complications including biliary obstruction and possible early hepatic encephalopathy. Given her current performance status, further chemotherapy would carry significant risks and is unlikely to provide benefit.\n\nPlan:\nReferral to palliative care team for urgent review\nDiscussion with hepatobiliary team regarding potential for biliary stenting\nIncrease in opiate doses with careful monitoring\nProvided emergency contact numbers to family\nFollow up with palliative care team next week\nOutpatient review in 2 weeks or earlier if needed",
