She underwent examination under anaesthesia on 5 Apr 2024 which confirmed a 2.8cm exophytic lesion confined to the cervix. She is currently well with minimal vaginal discharge and no bleeding. No significant past medical history.\n\nI have discussed treatment options with [redacted name] today. Given the stage and histology, I have recommended radical chemoradiotherapy with external beam radiotherapy and concurrent weekly cisplatin, followed by brachytherapy. She understands the aims of treatment and potential side effects. We will proceed with radiotherapy planning next week with aim to commence treatment in 2 weeks time. She will be reviewed weekly during treatment in the on-treatment review clinic.",
