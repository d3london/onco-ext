The scan shows stable disease in both primary site and bone metastases, with some sclerosis in previously lytic lesions suggesting treatment response. His swallowing has improved with previous radiotherapy to the cervical spine, though he continues to require soft diet modification. Recent blood tests show stable renal function and normal thyroid function. The main ongoing challenge is pain management, with breakthrough episodes despite regular oxycodone. We have increased his background opioids today and arranged urgent pain team review. After discussion with [redacted name] and his wife, we will continue with pembrolizumab given the evidence of disease stability and good tolerability. I have prescribed cycle 4 today and arranged follow-up CT in 6 weeks' time. We will review him again before cycle 5 with imaging results.",
