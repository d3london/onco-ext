She has made an excellent post-operative recovery with good wound healing. Given her node-negative status but high-risk biological features including Ki67 of 30%, I have recommended adjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel/carboplatin plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab (TCHP regimen), followed by completion of one year of HER2-directed therapy. We will arrange cardiac echo and baseline blood tests prior to starting treatment. I have also discussed the role of adjuvant endocrine therapy which will commence after chemotherapy completion. [redacted name] understands the treatment plan and wishes to proceed. We will see her next week to commence treatment once preliminary investigations are complete.",
