  "content": "Diagnosis:\nChordoid glioma of third ventricle, WHO grade II\nDiagnosed March 2024 following partial resection\nTTF1 and GFAP positive on immunohistochemistry\n\nPrevious medical history:\nMigraine\nHypothyroidism\n\nCurrent medications:\nDexamethasone 2mg daily\nLevothyroxine 100mcg daily\nLevetiracetam 500mg twice daily\n\nAllergies:\nNone known\n\nCurrent situation:\nCompleted fractionated radiotherapy 54Gy in 30 fractions on 15 April 2024\n\nMRI brain 1 May 2024 shows good response with reduction in residual disease\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who has completed radiotherapy to the residual chordoid glioma. She has tolerated treatment remarkably well with only mild fatigue and occasional headaches well controlled with regular paracetamol. Her initial presenting symptoms of intermittent confusion have completely resolved. Performance status remains 0. She has maintained good oral intake and weight is stable at 65kg.\n\nNeurological examination today shows no focal deficits. Visual fields are full to confrontation. Cranial nerves intact. Power and sensation normal in all limbs. Reflexes symmetrical.\n\nThe plan is to commence steroid weaning, reducing dexamethasone by 0.5mg every 2 weeks. We will arrange follow-up MRI brain in 3 months' time and review her in clinic with the results. She understands to contact us sooner if any new neurological symptoms develop.",
