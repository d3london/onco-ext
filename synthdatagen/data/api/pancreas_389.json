R0 resection achieved. Ki67 15%.\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following his recent surgery. He is recovering well with improving appetite and energy levels. His post-operative course was uncomplicated and his wound has healed well. His weight is stable at 72kg and his diabetes remains well controlled on current medications.\n\nWe discussed adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin/etoposide regime. I have explained the rationale, procedure and common side effects. [redacted name] wishes to proceed with treatment. His performance status is 1 and blood tests today show satisfactory renal and liver function for chemotherapy.\n\nThe plan is to commence adjuvant chemotherapy next week. We will arrange baseline CT chest/abdomen/pelvis prior to starting treatment.",
