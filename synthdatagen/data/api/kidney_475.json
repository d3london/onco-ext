Treatment has been well tolerated with only grade 1 fatigue and mild diarrhea managed with loperamide as needed. Performance status remains 0. Recent CT shows good partial response with 30% reduction in the primary tumor size. Blood pressure has remained stable on home monitoring with readings consistently below 140/90. Liver function tests are stable and thyroid function remains normal.\n\nThe plan is to continue pazopanib at full dose with review in 6 weeks. We will arrange repeat CT at that point to confirm ongoing response. [redacted name] understands to contact us if any problems develop in the interim, particularly regarding blood pressure or new side effects.",
