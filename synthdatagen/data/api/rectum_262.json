The treatment was well tolerated with only grade 1 diarrhea and mild fatigue. MRI pelvis on 2/5/24 shows excellent response with significant tumor regression (mrTRG 2). CEA has normalized from 12.4 to 2.1. Given the presence of NTRK fusion, we have discussed the option of targeted therapy with Entrectinib if required in future, though not indicated currently given localized disease. The plan is to proceed with TME surgery as scheduled on 20/6/24. We will review again post-operatively with final histology.",
