She has made an excellent recovery from her bilateral mastectomies and subsequent chemotherapy. Her energy levels have significantly improved since completing treatment, though she still experiences mild peripheral neuropathy affecting her fingertips from the taxane chemotherapy. She has maintained her weight and has returned to work part-time as a teacher. Clinical examination today shows well-healed mastectomy scars bilaterally with no concerning features. There is no lymphadenopathy or evidence of recurrence. Recent CT chest/abdomen/pelvis from 15/01/2024 shows no evidence of metastatic disease. Blood tests including liver function are all within normal range. The plan is to continue regular follow-up with clinical review and annual mammography of the chest wall. She will be reviewed again in clinic in 3 months' time.",
