  "content": "I reviewed [redacted name] today who is now completing cycle 4 of FOLFIRI chemotherapy for metastatic descending colon cancer. The initial diagnosis was made in January 2024 following investigation of iron deficiency anaemia, with colonoscopy showing a descending colon mass. Staging investigations revealed liver metastases in segments 6 and 7, with the largest measuring 4.2cm. Molecular testing confirmed NRAS G12C mutation with wild-type BRAF status.\n\nHe commenced FOLFIRI chemotherapy in February 2024 and has tolerated treatment well with only grade 1 fatigue and manageable nausea. Recent CT imaging shows an encouraging partial response with 40% reduction in the primary tumour size and similar improvements in the liver lesions. His CEA has fallen from 245 to 82.\n\nHe remains suitable to continue with the current regimen. We have prescribed cycle 5 today and arranged review before cycle 6 in three weeks. A progress CT scan will be performed after 6 cycles to guide ongoing management. The possibility of surgical reassessment will be considered at that point if the good response is maintained.",
