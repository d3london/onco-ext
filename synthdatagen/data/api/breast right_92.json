  "content": "Diagnosis:\nRight breast cancer - T3N0M0 invasive ductal carcinoma, basal-like phenotype\nER 8/8, PR 7/8, HER2 negative (1+)\nDiagnosed March 2024\n\nPrevious medical history:\nHypertension\nType 2 diabetes - diet controlled\n\nCurrent medications:\nRamipril 5mg daily\nMetformin 500mg twice daily\n\nAllergies:\nNone known\n\nCurrent situation:\nI was very pleased to meet [redacted name] today following her recent diagnosis of right breast cancer. She initially noticed a breast lump in January 2024 and promptly sought medical attention. Following triple assessment including mammogram, ultrasound and core biopsy on 15 March 2024, she was diagnosed with a 55mm mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Axillary ultrasound and subsequent biopsy showed no evidence of nodal involvement.\n\nOn examination today, there is a well-defined mass in the right upper outer quadrant measuring approximately 5.5cm. The skin is not involved and there is no nipple retraction. The left breast and both axillae are normal. Her performance status is 0 and she is managing well with normal daily activities.\n\nStaging CT chest/abdomen/pelvis performed on 28 March 2024 shows no evidence of metastatic disease. Blood tests including liver function and bone profile are all within normal range.\n\nI have had a detailed discussion with [redacted name] regarding treatment options. Given the size of the tumor but absence of nodal involvement, I have recommended neo-adjuvant chemotherapy to downstage the primary tumor prior to surgery. We discussed the planned regime of 3 cycles of FEC followed by 3 cycles of docetaxel. I have explained the common and serious side effects, including risk of neutropenic sepsis, and provided written information.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy starting next week. We will arrange baseline cardiac echo and insertion of PICC line. I will review her prior to each cycle of chemotherapy and arrange appropriate imaging to assess response after 3 cycles.",
