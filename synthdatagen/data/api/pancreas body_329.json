  "content": "Diagnosis:\nLocally advanced pancreatic clear cell carcinoma with liver and lung metastases, NTRK fusion positive\n\nPrevious treatment:\nCycle 1-4 FOLFIRINOX March-May 2024\nCommenced Larotrectinib 100mg BD June 2024 following molecular results\n\nCurrent medications:\nLarotrectinib 100mg BD\nCreon 25,000 units with meals\nLansoprazole 30mg OD\nOxycodone MR 30mg BD\n\nCurrent situation:\nPre cycle 3 assessment on Larotrectinib\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who is tolerating treatment well overall. The initial grade 2 transaminitis has resolved following temporary dose interruption and she has maintained stable disease on imaging. Her main symptoms are improving with better appetite and reduced abdominal pain. Weight has stabilized at 64kg.\n\nLatest CT (15/07/24) shows stable disease in pancreatic primary (4.2cm vs 4.3cm) and hepatic metastases. Small lung nodules unchanged. No new sites of disease.\n\nBlood results show normal LFTs, stable CA19-9 at 450 (previously 480).\n\nExamination reveals soft abdomen with no masses or tenderness. ECOG performance status remains 1.\n\nPlan is to continue Larotrectinib at current dose with next CT scan in 8 weeks. Will review in clinic in 4 weeks with blood tests including LFTs.",
