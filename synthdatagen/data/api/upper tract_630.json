  "content": "Diagnosis:\tUrothelial carcinoma of upper urinary tract (micropapillary variant)\n\nI was very pleased to see [redacted name] in clinic today for routine follow-up. As you will recall, she underwent right nephroureterectomy in January 2024 for a T2N0M0 upper tract urothelial carcinoma with micropapillary features. Molecular testing revealed an FGFR3/TACC3 fusion. She completed 4 cycles of adjuvant gemcitabine-cisplatin in May 2024 which she tolerated remarkably well with only grade 1 fatigue and occasional nausea.\n\nI am delighted to report that she continues to make excellent progress. Her energy levels have significantly improved since completing chemotherapy, and she has returned to her regular swimming three times per week. She denies any urinary symptoms or flank pain. Her appetite is good and her weight has remained stable at 68kg. She remains very positive about her progress and is coping well emotionally with support from her family.\n\nOn examination today, her surgical sites are well-healed, and abdominal examination is unremarkable. Her recent CT urogram from 15th July 2024 shows no evidence of disease recurrence, and her renal function remains stable with creatinine 110 μmol/L. We have discussed the surveillance plan, which includes regular cystoscopy with our urology colleagues and 6-monthly cross-sectional imaging. She understands to contact us if she develops any new concerning symptoms in the interim.\n\nWe will arrange repeat CT urogram in January 2025 and see her back in clinic afterwards to review the results.",
