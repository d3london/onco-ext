  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMalignant melanoma right calf, pT4b (Breslow 6.2mm, ulcerated) with right inguinal nodal metastases (2/5 nodes positive). BRAF V600E positive, PD-L1 55%.\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today for week 12 assessment on the KEYNOTE-A355 trial comparing pembrolizumab/lenvatinib combination versus standard pembrolizumab monotherapy in stage III melanoma. She completed the screening phase in January 2024 and was randomized to the combination arm.\n\nShe has completed 4 cycles of treatment with good tolerability overall. Her main side effect has been grade 1 fatigue which is manageable. Blood pressure remains well controlled on amlodipine 5mg daily which was started at cycle 2. Latest thyroid function shows subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH 6.8) but she remains asymptomatic - we will continue to monitor this closely.\n\nCT chest/abdomen/pelvis performed last week shows excellent partial response with 60% reduction in right inguinal nodes compared to baseline. No new sites of disease. Her performance status remains 0 and she continues working full-time.\n\nBloods today show stable liver function, normal renal function, and adequate hematological parameters for cycle 5. We have prescribed the next cycle of trial medication. She will continue with 3-weekly pembrolizumab and daily oral lenvatinib as per protocol. Next trial assessment is due in 3 weeks with repeat thyroid function, trial-specific quality of life questionnaires, and toxicity review.",
