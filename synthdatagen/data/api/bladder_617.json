  "content": "I reviewed [redacted name] today following recent admission with deteriorating symptoms. Unfortunately his metastatic bladder cancer has shown clear evidence of progression despite third line treatment.\n\nHe was initially diagnosed in January 2024 with sarcomatoid carcinoma of the bladder following investigation of haematuria. Initial staging demonstrated a 7.2cm bladder mass with extensive pelvic lymphadenopathy and widespread bone metastases particularly affecting the thoracic spine and pelvis. Molecular profiling identified NF2 loss. First-line treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin was commenced in February 2024 but discontinued after 2 cycles due to significant deterioration in renal function. He subsequently received second-line pembrolizumab from March 2024, but unfortunately developed immune-related hepatitis requiring high-dose steroids. Following resolution of hepatitis, he commenced third-line vinflunine in April 2024.\n\nHe was admitted last week with severe back pain, increasing breathlessness, and marked deterioration in mobility. CT imaging showed clear disease progression with new vertebral metastases at T4 and T7 causing cord compression, enlarging pelvic lymphadenopathy, and new pulmonary metastases. His performance status has declined significantly to ECOG 3, now spending most of the day in bed. He requires regular oxygenation and has needed increasing doses of opioid analgesia.\n\nOn examination today, he appears cachectic with marked muscle wasting. Chest examination reveals reduced air entry at both bases with dull percussion note. There is significant tenderness over the thoracic spine with limited mobility due to pain. Blood tests show deteriorating renal function with eGFR 32 (previously 45) and rising calcium at 2.89.\n\nI have had a detailed discussion with [redacted name] and his family about the clear evidence of disease progression and poor prognosis. Given his deteriorating performance status and organ function, I do not feel that further systemic anti-cancer therapy would be appropriate or safe. We have agreed to focus on symptom control and quality of life. I have arranged urgent radiotherapy to the thoracic spine for pain control and to address the cord compression risk. The palliative care team reviewed him during admission and will provide ongoing support. We have optimised his analgesia with increased sustained-release morphine and breakthrough oxycodone.\n\nHe will be followed up by the palliative care team next week, with telephone support from our team as needed. I have prescribed zoledronic acid for hypercalcaemia and arranged weekly blood tests through the community team.",
