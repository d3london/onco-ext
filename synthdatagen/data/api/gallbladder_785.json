Gallbladder adenocarcinoma with liver metastases\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tMarch 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Mar 2024 Diagnostic laparoscopy and biopsy\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tNot indicated\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tGemcitabine/Cisplatin commenced 28 Mar 2024\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tPartial response to first-line chemotherapy\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tMild peripheral neuropathy, stable liver function\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 64-year-old lady was diagnosed following investigation of right upper quadrant pain and weight loss. Initial CT showed a 4.2cm gallbladder mass with three liver metastases in segments 4a, 7, and 8, measuring up to 3.5cm. Diagnostic laparoscopy confirmed unresectable disease. Biopsy showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, HER2 negative, MSI-low.\n\nShe has completed two cycles of Gemcitabine/Cisplatin with good tolerability. Latest CT shows 30% reduction in liver metastases and primary mass. Blood tests show improving liver function with bilirubin now normal at 15, ALT 45, ALP 225.\n\nPerformance status remains 1. She reports grade 1 peripheral neuropathy affecting fingertips only. Appetite has improved and weight has stabilized at 68kg.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tCT chest/abdomen/pelvis after cycle 4\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tOndansetron 8mg bd for 3 days post-chemotherapy\nDexamethasone 8mg bd for 3 days post-chemotherapy\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up in 2 weeks pre-cycle 3\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly FBC, U&Es, LFTs during chemotherapy",
