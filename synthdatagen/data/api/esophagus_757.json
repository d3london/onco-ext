He reports new onset right upper quadrant discomfort and thoracic back pain requiring regular opioid analgesia.\n\nEndoscopy on 15/03/2024 revealed a circumferential tumor at 32-40cm. Staging investigations include CT chest/abdomen/pelvis (22/03/2024) showing the primary tumor with extensive local invasion, multiple liver metastases (largest 6.2cm in segment 7), and bone metastases affecting T8, T10, and left iliac crest. PET-CT (28/03/2024) confirms widespread FDG-avid disease.\n\nHis performance status has declined from ECOG 1 to ECOG 2 over the past month. He requires liquid nutritional supplements and can only manage soft diet. He lives with his wife who provides good support, though managing stairs at home has become challenging.\n\nWe have discussed treatment options in detail. Given his HER2-positive status, I recommend combination chemotherapy with Cisplatin/5-FU plus Trastuzumab. I have explained the aims of treatment are to improve his symptoms and extend survival. We have discussed common side effects including risk of neutropenic sepsis, mucositis, and cardiac toxicity.\n\nPlan:\n1. Commence Cisplatin/5-FU/Trastuzumab pending baseline cardiac echo\n2. Urgent referral for esophageal stent placement\n3. Referral to palliative care team for bone pain management\n4. Review in 1 week with baseline investigations\n5. Consider radiotherapy to symptomatic bone metastases after initial systemic therapy response assessment",
