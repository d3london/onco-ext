  "content": "Diagnosis:\tProstate adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation\n\nManagement:\t15 Jan 2024 Commenced ADT (Leuprorelin)\n\t\t12 Feb 2024 Started Docetaxel chemotherapy\n\t\t20 Mar 2024 Completed cycle 3 Docetaxel\n\nHistology:\tMixed adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features\n\tGleason 4+5=9\n\tSPOP mutation detected\n\nCurrent Situation:\tPost cycle 3 Docetaxel review\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] following completion of cycle 3 Docetaxel chemotherapy. His initial presentation in December 2023 showed locally advanced prostate cancer with pelvic nodal involvement on staging MRI and CT. Initial PSA was 67.8 ng/mL. Bone scan showed no evidence of skeletal metastases. Histology confirmed Gleason 4+5=9 disease with focal neuroendocrine differentiation. Molecular testing detected SPOP mutation.\n\nHe commenced ADT with Leuprorelin in January 2024 followed by Docetaxel chemotherapy from February 2024. Latest PSA has fallen to 12.4. He has tolerated treatment relatively well with grade 1 fatigue and minimal peripheral neuropathy. Performance status remains 1.\n\nThe case was discussed at today's Uro-oncology MDT. Given the good biochemical response and stable imaging appearances on recent CT, the recommendation is to complete the planned 6 cycles of Docetaxel followed by consideration of prostate radiotherapy depending on the PSA response.\n\nPlan is to proceed with cycle 4 Docetaxel next week. Will arrange repeat CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after cycle 6 and review in combined clinic with latest PSA to discuss radiotherapy timing.",
