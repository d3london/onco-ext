He has recovered well from his radiotherapy treatment which was completed in March. His urinary symptoms have largely resolved with only mild frequency remaining. His bowel function has returned to normal. He maintains good energy levels and has resumed his regular golf activities.\n\nOn examination today, his performance status is 0. Digital rectal examination shows post-radiotherapy changes only with no concerning features.\n\nHis PSA has shown an appropriate early response, dropping from 4.8 to 1.2. We will continue PSA monitoring every 3 months for the first year. I have arranged his next PSA check for August 2024 with clinic review to follow. He understands to contact us sooner if he develops any new concerns.",
