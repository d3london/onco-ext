  "content": "Diagnosis:\tLocalized tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma, right kidney\n\nManagement:\t15 Mar 2024 Right partial nephrectomy\n\nHistology:\tTubulocystic renal cell carcinoma, 3.2cm, confined to kidney. Margins clear. KDM5C mutation detected.\n\nCurrent Situation:\tFirst post-operative oncology assessment\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following his recent right partial nephrectomy for localized renal cell carcinoma. He has made an excellent recovery from surgery with minimal post-operative pain and good wound healing. His renal function remains stable with creatinine 98 umol/L (pre-operative baseline 92).\n\nHe is otherwise fit and well with no significant past medical history apart from well-controlled hypertension on ramipril. He works as an accountant and has already returned to work part-time. He lives with his wife and maintains an active lifestyle including regular cycling.\n\nOn examination today, his surgical wounds are well-healed. His blood pressure is 138/82 and heart rate 72 regular. Chest is clear and abdomen soft with no masses or tenderness.\n\nI have reviewed his imaging and histology in detail. The CT chest/abdomen/pelvis from 1 March 2024 showed a 3.4cm mass in the right kidney with no evidence of local invasion or metastatic disease. Post-operative histology confirms a tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma, completely excised with clear margins. Molecular analysis has detected a KDM5C mutation.\n\nGiven the localized nature of the disease and complete surgical excision, I have recommended surveillance rather than adjuvant therapy. We will arrange CT chest/abdomen/pelvis in 6 months' time and see him back in clinic with the results. I have provided written information about symptoms to watch for and contact details for the specialist nursing team.\n\nHe understands the surveillance plan and has no immediate concerns. His GP will continue to monitor his blood pressure and renal function.",
