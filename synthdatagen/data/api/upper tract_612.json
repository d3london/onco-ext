  "content": "Previous medical history:\nTransitional cell carcinoma right renal pelvis diagnosed January 2024\nHypertension\nType 2 diabetes\n\nCurrent medications:\nErdafitinib 8mg daily\nMetformin\nAmlodipine\n\nCurrent situation:\nCycle 2 review of erdafitinib therapy\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of cycle 2 erdafitinib. The initial 8mg daily dose has been well tolerated with only grade 1 dry eyes requiring artificial tears. Phosphate levels remain within normal range at 3.8mmol/L. CT urogram performed on 15 March 2024 shows excellent partial response with 60% reduction in right renal pelvis mass from 3.2cm to 1.3cm. No evidence of local or distant progression.\n\nThe plan is to continue erdafitinib at current dose with monthly ophthalmology review as per protocol. Next CT assessment due in 8 weeks. Will review in clinic in 4 weeks with blood results including phosphate levels. Patient understands to contact if any new eye symptoms or other concerns develop.",
