  "content": "Diagnosis:\tLocally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma\n\nManagement:\tCommenced induction chemotherapy 15 Mar 2024\n\nHistology:\tUndifferentiated carcinoma, EBV positive on EBER-ISH\n\nCurrent Situation:\tPre cycle 2 TPF induction chemotherapy\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following his first cycle of TPF (Docetaxel, Cisplatin, 5-FU) induction chemotherapy. He initially presented with a 4-month history of right-sided neck swelling and occasional epistaxis. Nasendoscopy revealed a right-sided nasopharyngeal mass, and biopsy confirmed undifferentiated carcinoma which was EBV positive. Staging CT and MRI showed a 4.2cm nasopharyngeal primary tumor with right level II/III nodal disease, the largest node measuring 3.1cm. PET-CT confirmed no distant metastases.\n\nHe has tolerated the first cycle of chemotherapy well with grade 1 nausea and mild fatigue only. No significant mucositis or ototoxicity. His right neck swelling has noticeably reduced. Performance status remains 0. Examination today shows reducing right cervical lymphadenopathy. Blood results are satisfactory for proceeding with cycle 2.\n\nThe plan is to complete 3 cycles of induction TPF followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. We will proceed with cycle 2 today and arrange interim imaging after cycle 3.",
