  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMetastatic adenocarcinoma of left lower lobe lung with bone and brain metastases\n\nManagement:\t2023 Dec - Whole brain radiotherapy\n\t\t2024 Jan - Started Carboplatin/Paclitaxel/Trastuzumab\n\nHistology:\tAdenocarcinoma, HER2 amplified, PD-L1 20%\n\nCurrent Situation:\tPre-cycle 4 chemotherapy review\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today prior to cycle 4 of systemic therapy. She is tolerating treatment relatively well with grade 1 fatigue and mild peripheral neuropathy affecting fingertips only. Her headaches have significantly improved following whole brain radiotherapy. Recent staging CT chest/abdomen/pelvis (15 March 2024) shows stable disease in primary lung lesion and bone metastases. MRI brain (12 March 2024) confirms partial response of brain metastases with reduction in size and surrounding edema.\n\nPerformance status remains 1. She continues to live independently with support from her daughter. She is managing regular short walks and light housework.\n\nPlan to proceed with cycle 4 chemotherapy today. Will arrange repeat imaging after cycle 6. Follow-up appointment in 3 weeks.",
