She remains clinically stable with no new neurological symptoms. Her headaches have resolved following the completion of steroids, and she has maintained good functional status with return to university studies. No focal neurological deficits on examination today. Latest MRI brain (15/4/24) shows post-treatment changes with no evidence of disease progression. Blood tests including renal function are satisfactory.\n\nThe plan is to continue surveillance with next MRI brain in 3 months. Will review in clinic following imaging. She understands to contact us sooner if any new symptoms develop.",
