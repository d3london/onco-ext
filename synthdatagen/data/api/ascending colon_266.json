  "content": "Diagnosis:\nMetastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma of ascending colon with liver and lung metastases\n\nInitial Staging:\nT4aN2bM0 (Stage IIIB) at diagnosis January 2023\nProgressed to metastatic disease March 2024\n\nBiomarker Status:\nERBB2 (HER2) amplification detected?\nMicrosatellite stable\nBRAF wild type\nKRAS wild type\n\nPrevious Treatment:\nRight hemicolectomy January 2023\nAdjuvant CAPOX completed July 2023\nPalliative FOLFIRI/Bevacizumab March-May 2024\n\nCurrent Situation:\nDisease progression on current treatment\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who attended with his wife. Unfortunately, his most recent CT scan from 15th May 2024 shows clear evidence of disease progression with growth of both liver metastases (largest lesion increased from 3.2cm to 4.8cm) and new pulmonary nodules. His performance status has declined to ECOG 2, with increasing fatigue and right upper quadrant discomfort requiring regular breakthrough analgesia.\n\nHe has also developed grade 3 neutropenia with his current FOLFIRI/Bevacizumab regimen, requiring two dose reductions and multiple treatment delays. His latest blood tests show deteriorating liver function with bilirubin 45 and ALT 156.\n\nGiven the confirmation of ERBB2 amplification in his tumor, and clear evidence of disease progression, I have discussed switching his treatment to FOLFIRI with Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab. I have explained the rationale for this change and potential side effects, including cardiac monitoring requirements. [redacted name] understands this represents his best treatment option at present.\n\nPlan:\n1. Discontinue current FOLFIRI/Bevacizumab\n2. Arrange baseline cardiac ECHO and ECG\n3. Start FOLFIRI/Trastuzumab/Pertuzumab once cardiac assessment complete\n4. Weekly review of liver function\n5. Urgent referral to palliative care team for symptom management\n6. CT reassessment after 3 cycles\n\nWe will review him again in one week with cardiac results and to commence new treatment regimen if appropriate.",
