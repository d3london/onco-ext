He continues on bicalutamide monotherapy which was started in January 2024. His PSA has shown an excellent response, dropping from 4.2 to 0.8. Treatment tolerance has been good with only mild hot flushes reported. He maintains good energy levels and has continued his regular swimming. Clinical examination today shows no concerning features. The plan is to continue current treatment and arrange PSA monitoring in 6 weeks through his GP. We will review him again in clinic in 3 months with repeat PSA.",
