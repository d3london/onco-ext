Initial staging shows bilateral synchronous lung primaries with the largest measuring 4.2cm in the right upper lobe and 3.1cm in the left lower lobe, with multiple mediastinal nodes (stations 4R, 7, and 10R positive on mediastinoscopy). Molecular analysis has confirmed MYCN amplification. Brain MRI shows no evidence of metastatic disease.\n\nHe has completed all trial screening investigations including cardiac echo (EF 62%), respiratory function tests (FEV1 2.8L, 85% predicted), and required blood tests. All eligibility criteria have been met. We have thoroughly discussed the trial protocol, potential benefits and risks, and he has signed the informed consent after a 24-hour cooling-off period.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tBaseline CT chest/abdomen/pelvis scheduled for 22 Apr 2024\n\tBaseline cardiac troponin and NT-proBNP to be done pre-cycle 1\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tNone\n\n\tFollow up\n\tTrial treatment to commence 24 Apr 2024\n\tWeekly review during first cycle\n\tNext oncology follow up in one week for cycle 1 day 1\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly FBC, U&E, LFTs during first cycle\n\n\tSummary of information given to the patient\n\tFull trial information provided including treatment schedule, potential side effects, and emergency contact details.
