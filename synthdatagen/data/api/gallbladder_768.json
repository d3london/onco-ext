  "content": "Diagnosis:\nGallbladder adenocarcinoma T4N1M1, HER2 amplified\n\nPrevious treatment:\nCycle 1-4 Gemcitabine/Cisplatin completed March 2024\nDisease progression on CT April 2024\n\nCurrent situation:\nRapidly progressive disease with new liver metastases and deteriorating performance status\n\nMDT Discussion 25 April 2024:\nComprehensive review of imaging showing marked progression with new liver metastases (segments 4a, 7, and 8 largest measuring 4.2cm) and enlarging porta hepatis nodes. Primary gallbladder mass now measures 8.6cm with direct liver invasion. Recent HER2 testing on liver biopsy shows FISH amplification. Performance status deteriorated to ECOG 2. Significant right upper quadrant pain requiring increased opiate analgesia. Marked weight loss of 6kg over 8 weeks.\n\nMDT Recommendations:\n1. Switch to second-line treatment with Trastuzumab/FOLFOX given HER2 positivity\n2. Urgent CT-guided biopsy of segment 7 liver lesion to confirm HER2 status in metastatic disease\n3. Consider palliative radiotherapy to gallbladder mass if pain persists\n4. Early palliative care involvement\n\nPlan:\nWill see in clinic next week to discuss MDT recommendations and commence second-line treatment if appropriate. Urgent CT-guided biopsy being arranged. Have requested palliative care review. Blood tests including liver function and tumour markers to be checked prior to clinic review.",
