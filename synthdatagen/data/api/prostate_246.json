  "content": "I was pleased to review [redacted name] in follow up clinic today. He is now 6 months post-diagnosis of T1c prostate adenocarcinoma with squamoid features, initially diagnosed following raised PSA screening. His initial PSA was 4.8 and biopsy in March 2024 confirmed Gleason 3+4=7 disease in 2 of 12 cores, with AR-V7 positive status. He commenced androgen deprivation therapy with Leuprorelin 3-monthly injections in April 2024 and has tolerated this well with only mild hot flushes. His most recent PSA from last week has fallen appropriately to 0.6. He maintains good energy levels and continues his usual activities. Clinical examination today was unremarkable. He will continue with his current hormonal therapy and I have arranged PSA monitoring in 3 months' time with clinic review thereafter. A repeat CT scan will be arranged for 6 months' time as per protocol.",
