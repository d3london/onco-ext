She has made an excellent recovery from her operation with no post-operative complications. Her surgical wounds have healed well and she reports no new symptoms. Her appetite and weight are stable. Blood tests including chromogranin A are within normal range. Recent CT scan on 15/4/24 shows no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. Her diabetes is well-controlled on metformin. The plan is to continue surveillance with 6-monthly CT imaging and annual chromogranin A measurements. We will review her again in clinic in 6 months with repeat imaging.",
