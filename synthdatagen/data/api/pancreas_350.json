CT pancreas showed a 3.2cm mass in the pancreatic head with no evidence of metastatic disease. CA19-9 was elevated at 850. Following successful biliary stenting and tissue diagnosis, his liver function has normalized and performance status is 1. No significant comorbidities apart from well-controlled hypertension on ramipril. Lives with wife and continues to work part-time as an accountant. On examination today, mild epigastric tenderness but no other significant findings. Given his good performance status and BRCA2 mutation status, I have recommended neo-adjuvant FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy. He will require PICC line insertion and baseline cardiac echo before commencing treatment.",
