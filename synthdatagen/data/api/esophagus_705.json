  "content": "Diagnosis:\tT3N1M0 adenocarcinoma of lower esophagus, HER2 positive (3+)\n\nDiagnosed following investigation of progressive dysphagia. Upper GI endoscopy on 15 March 2024 revealed a 4cm circumferential lesion at 32-36cm. Biopsies confirmed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. CT and PET-CT staging showed locally advanced disease with regional nodal involvement but no distant metastases.\n\nIn her past medical history, she has hypertension and osteoarthritis. Current medications include ramipril 5mg od, amlodipine 10mg od, and paracetamol prn. No known drug allergies.\n\nShe lives with her husband who provides good support. She is an ex-smoker having quit 10 years ago. She drinks minimal alcohol.\n\nOn examination today, she appears well with PS 1. Weight is stable at 68kg. Cardiorespiratory examination normal. No cervical lymphadenopathy. Abdomen soft and non-tender.\n\nCase was discussed at Upper GI MDT on 12 April 2024. Given HER2 positive status, recommendation is for perioperative chemotherapy with FLOT plus trastuzumab, followed by surgery. I have discussed this plan with [redacted name] and her husband today. They understand the treatment intent and potential side effects.\n\nPlan is to commence chemotherapy next week. We will arrange baseline cardiac echo, hearing test, and dental assessment. Review in 3 weeks with blood tests. CT reassessment after 4 cycles.",
