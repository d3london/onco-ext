Child-Pugh A5 liver function with background hepatitis B cirrhosis.\n\nTreatment with TACE to all lesions April 2023 and July 2023 with good response.\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today in follow-up clinic. He remains well with stable performance status and good appetite. No symptoms suggestive of disease progression. Latest AFP has fallen to 120. Recent triple-phase CT liver (15/09/2023) shows stable post-TACE appearances with no new lesions identified. Child-Pugh score remains A5 with well-preserved synthetic function.\n\nThe plan is to continue surveillance with 3-monthly AFP and imaging. Next triple-phase CT liver arranged for December 2023. Will review in clinic with results. Patient understands to contact us sooner if new symptoms develop.",
