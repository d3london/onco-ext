She has recovered well from her treatment with resolution of previous grade 1 peripheral neuropathy. Her weight has stabilized at 68kg and appetite has improved. She reports good energy levels and has returned to work part-time.\n\nCurrent blood tests show stable CA19-9 at 15 (within normal range). Recent CT scan on 15/5/24 shows post-surgical changes with no evidence of disease recurrence. Liver function tests remain normal.\n\nThe plan is to continue regular surveillance. I have arranged follow up CT scan in 3 months and clinic review thereafter. She understands to contact us sooner if any new concerns develop.",
