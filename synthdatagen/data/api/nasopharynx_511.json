  "content": "Diagnosis:\tNasopharyngeal carcinoma (undifferentiated, EBV positive)\n\tStage T2N1M0, PDL1 CPS 25\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin. He has responded well to treatment with resolution of his initial symptoms of nasal obstruction and epistaxis. His taste and swallowing have gradually improved since completing radiotherapy, though he still reports some dry mouth which is managed with regular sips of water.\n\nClinical examination shows good healing of the radiation-affected areas with no evidence of active disease in the nasopharynx or neck. His weight has stabilized at 72kg and his performance status remains 0.\n\nRecent MRI neck (April 2024) shows complete response to treatment with resolution of the primary tumor and previously involved right level II lymph node. Blood tests including EBV DNA are within normal range.\n\nThe plan is to continue regular follow-up. I have arranged CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for surveillance in 3 months and will see him again following those results. He understands to contact us sooner if he develops any new concerning symptoms.",
