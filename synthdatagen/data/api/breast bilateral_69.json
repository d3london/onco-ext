She reports worsening breathlessness over past 2 weeks, now requiring 2L oxygen at rest. Performance status has declined to ECOG 3. Recent CT chest shows multiple new pulmonary nodules and increase in existing metastases despite 3 cycles of immunotherapy/chemotherapy. Her weight has dropped by 4kg since last review.\n\nGiven clear evidence of disease progression and declining performance status, we have discussed transitioning to palliative care focus. I have made urgent referral to palliative care team and arranged community oxygen assessment. We will hold further systemic therapy. Patient and family are in agreement with plan.\n\nPlan:\t\t\tUrgent palliative care review\n\t\t\tCommunity oxygen assessment\n\t\t\tFollow up in 2 weeks with palliative team",
