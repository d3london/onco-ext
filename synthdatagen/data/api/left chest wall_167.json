PTEN loss on molecular testing.\n\nCurrent situation:\tPre cycle 2 carboplatin/etoposide\n\n[redacted name] has completed cycle 1 of adjuvant carboplatin/etoposide following surgical resection of her left chest wall small cell carcinoma. She has tolerated the first cycle well with only grade 1 fatigue and mild nausea well controlled with standard antiemetics. Her neutrophils dropped to 0.9 on day 10 but recovered spontaneously. She reports good energy levels and has maintained her weight. She has experienced some mild peripheral neuropathy affecting her fingertips only. Her port-a-cath is functioning well with no complications. Today's blood tests show adequate parameters for cycle 2. Given the good tolerability, we will proceed with full dose cycle 2 today. I have arranged CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after cycle 3 to assess response. We will review her again in 3 weeks prior to cycle 3. She understands to contact the acute oncology service if she develops any concerning symptoms.",
