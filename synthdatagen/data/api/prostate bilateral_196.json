  "content": "Diagnosis:\nMetastatic prostate adenocarcinoma with bone and brain metastases\nInitial PSA 567 (January 2024)\nCHEK2 mutation positive\n\nPrevious Treatment:\nAndrogen deprivation therapy commenced January 2024\nDocetaxel chemotherapy commenced February 2024 - completed 3 cycles\nEmergency whole brain radiotherapy March 2024 for symptomatic cerebral metastases\n\nPrevious medical history:\nType 2 diabetes\nHypertension\nChronic kidney disease stage 3\n\nCurrent medications:\nLeuprorelin 3-monthly\nDexamethasone 4mg twice daily\nAbiraterone 1000mg daily\nPrednisolone 5mg twice daily\nApixaban for cancer-associated thrombosis\n\nCurrent situation:\nProgressive disease with rising PSA (now 890) and new neurological symptoms\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who attended with his wife. Unfortunately, he has experienced significant clinical deterioration over the past two weeks with worsening mobility and new onset confusion. His performance status has declined from 1 to 3. Despite initial response to whole brain radiotherapy, he has developed recurrent headaches and right-sided weakness. Recent MRI shows progression of cerebral metastases with associated edema.\n\nHis PSA has risen from 567 to 890 despite being on abiraterone for the past 6 weeks. He has also developed new bone pain affecting his thoracic spine and right hip, requiring increased opiate analgesia.\n\nAfter careful discussion with [redacted name] and his wife, we have agreed to discontinue abiraterone given the clear evidence of disease progression. Given his declining performance status and the aggressive nature of his disease, I have recommended transition to best supportive care with involvement of the palliative care team. I have increased his dexamethasone dose to help manage the cerebral edema and referred him urgently to the palliative care team.\n\nThe plan is for telephone review by the palliative care team within 48 hours. I have also arranged urgent hospice assessment. We will continue current medications including dexamethasone and analgesia, but discontinue abiraterone and prednisolone. I have provided emergency contact details and arranged weekly community nurse follow-up.",
