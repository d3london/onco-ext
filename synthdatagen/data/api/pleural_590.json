CT thorax/abdomen shows stable disease with no new sites of disease. The right pleural thickening remains unchanged from previous imaging, measuring maximum 32mm. Small volume peritoneal disease remains stable. Blood tests show stable renal function with eGFR 68. Latest pemetrexed cycle was well tolerated with only grade 1 fatigue. Plan to continue with maintenance pemetrexed and arrange repeat imaging in 3 months.",
