  "content": "Diagnosis:\tGastric adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell features\n\nManagement:\t15 Jan 2024 Subtotal gastrectomy\n\nHistology:\tpT2N1(2/15)M0 poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell features, R0 resection. PDL1 CPS 3, MSI stable.\n\nCurrent Situation:\tCycle 3 CAPOX adjuvant chemotherapy\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today in the chemotherapy assessment clinic. The first two cycles of adjuvant CAPOX have been well tolerated with only grade 1 nausea and minimal peripheral neuropathy. Blood parameters remain satisfactory with stable renal function. Weight has stabilized at 68kg and nutritional intake is adequate with support from our dietitian. Post-operative recovery continues to progress well with improving exercise tolerance.\n\nI am happy to proceed with cycle 3 CAPOX today as planned. We will arrange CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after cycle 4 for interim disease assessment. Follow-up appointment will be made for 3 weeks' time prior to cycle 4.",
