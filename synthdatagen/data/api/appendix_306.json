The first three cycles of capecitabine have been well tolerated with only grade 1 palmar-plantar syndrome which has been effectively managed with regular moisturizing. Her abdominal distension has marginally improved, and she reports feeling less bloated after meals. Weight has stabilized at 64kg. Recent CT performed on 15/3/24 shows stable disease with no significant change in the peritoneal disease volume compared to baseline imaging. Tumor markers show gradual improvement with CEA decreasing from 24 to 18.\n\nPerformance status remains 1. Blood results today are satisfactory for continuing treatment. We have discussed proceeding with cycle 4 of capecitabine at the same dose. The case will be re-discussed at the peritoneal malignancy MDT next week to consider timing of interval imaging and potential cytoreductive surgery. We will review again in 3 weeks with blood tests.",
