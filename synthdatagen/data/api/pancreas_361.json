Mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasm (MiNEN) of pancreatic body\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2024 Diagnostic laparoscopy and biopsy\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t1. Carboplatin/Etoposide from 01-02-24 to 15-03-24 (2 cycles)\n\t2. CAPTEM (Capecitabine/Temozolomide) commenced 4/4/24\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNot eligible\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive peritoneal disease with rising Chromogranin A\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tWorsening abdominal pain and early satiety\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who has unfortunately experienced significant clinical deterioration since our last review. The patient was initially diagnosed with a mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasm of the pancreatic body in January 2024, confirmed on diagnostic laparoscopy. Initial treatment with Carboplatin/Etoposide was commenced in February 2024, but after two cycles, CT imaging demonstrated disease progression with new peritoneal deposits.\n\nThe decision was made to switch to CAPTEM (Capecitabine/Temozolomide) in early April, but unfortunately, the patient has continued to deteriorate clinically. Chromogranin A has risen from 250 ng/mL to 450 ng/mL over the past month. The patient reports worsening abdominal pain requiring increased opiate analgesia, and early satiety due to peritoneal disease burden. Performance status has declined from ECOG 1 to ECOG 3.\n\nOn examination today, there is marked abdominal distension with shifting dullness suggesting ascites. There is tenderness in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant. The patient appears cachectic with evident muscle wasting.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tUrgent CT scan booked for next week\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tOxycodone MR increased to 40mg BD\n\tMetoclopramide 10mg TDS\n\n\tFollow up\n\tUrgent review in 1 week with scan results\n\tReferral made to palliative care team\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPlease monitor renal function and electrolytes\n\tPlease titrate analgesia as needed following palliative care review",
