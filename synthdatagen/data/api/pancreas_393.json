The change from FOLFIRINOX was necessitated by cumulative myelosuppression despite G-CSF support and 20% dose reduction. CT performed on 15/4/24 shows encouraging 30% reduction in pancreatic mass and stable peritoneal disease. Performance status remains 1. Blood results today show improvement in neutrophils to 2.8 and platelets 156. The initial neuropathy has resolved. Appetite has improved with weight gain of 2kg since changing regimen.\n\nPlan to proceed with cycle 2 Gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel at full dose. Will arrange CT reassessment after cycle 4. Review in 3 weeks with blood tests.",
