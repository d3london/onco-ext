  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMetastatic melanoma (BRAF wild type, NRAS mutant)\n\nManagement:\t2023 Wide local excision of right shoulder primary melanoma\n\t\tJune 2023 - Dec 2023 Pembrolizumab monotherapy\n\t\tJan 2024 - March 2024 Ipilimumab/Nivolumab combination\n\nHistology:\tUlcerated melanoma, Breslow thickness 5.2mm, mitotic rate 6/mm2\n\nCurrent Situation:\tProgressive disease on immunotherapy combination\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who attended with his wife. Unfortunately, his most recent CT scan from last week shows clear evidence of disease progression with growth of existing liver metastases and development of new pulmonary nodules. The largest liver lesion has increased from 3.2cm to 4.8cm, and there are now multiple new sub-centimeter lung metastases. This is despite completing 4 cycles of Ipilimumab/Nivolumab combination therapy.\n\nHis performance status has declined to ECOG 2, largely due to increasing fatigue and right upper quadrant discomfort from his liver disease. He reports reduced appetite and has lost 4kg over the past month despite nutritional supplements. He is experiencing increasing breathlessness on exertion, though oxygen saturations remain adequate at 96% on air at rest.\n\nHe has ongoing grade 2 colitis from immunotherapy requiring prednisolone 20mg daily, which has improved from its initial presentation but is still causing 4-5 loose stools daily. His thyroid function remains suppressed on levothyroxine replacement following immunotherapy-induced thyroiditis.\n\nOn examination today, there is tender hepatomegaly extending 4cm below the costal margin. Chest examination reveals fine bilateral basal crepitations. There are no concerning cutaneous lesions.\n\nI have discussed these findings with [redacted name] and his wife. Given the clear evidence of progressive disease and declining performance status, I have explained that we need to change our treatment approach. We have discussed the option of chemotherapy with Dacarbazine, acknowledging the modest response rates but noting it may offer disease control. They understand this would be primarily palliative in intent.\n\nI have arranged urgent referral to the palliative care team for additional support with symptom management. We will commence weekly clinical reviews during chemotherapy if he wishes to proceed. I have also organized repeat liver function tests and clotting profile for later this week to guide treatment timing.\n\nThe plan is to review him next week with these results to initiate chemotherapy if appropriate. I have provided emergency contact details and clear instructions about symptoms that should prompt urgent medical attention.",
