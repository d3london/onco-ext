  "content": "I reviewed [redacted name] today who attended with his wife following recent CT imaging showing disease progression. He was initially diagnosed with p16 positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma in January 2024, presenting with T4aN2c disease and synchronous lung and liver metastases. His initial treatment comprised pembrolizumab-platinum-5FU combination which he started on 15th February 2024, achieving an initial partial response after 3 cycles.\n\nUnfortunately, his most recent CT performed on 15th May 2024 shows clear evidence of disease progression with enlarging liver metastases (largest lesion increased from 2.8cm to 4.5cm) and new pulmonary nodules. His primary disease remains stable. He has also developed significant symptoms over the past 3 weeks with increasing fatigue, reduced oral intake, and weight loss of 4kg. His performance status has declined from ECOG 1 to ECOG 3.\n\nHis past medical history includes well-controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Current medications include metformin, ramipril, and regular oxycodone for pain control which has recently been increased to 40mg BD. He is experiencing grade 2 peripheral neuropathy from previous cisplatin therapy.\n\nOn examination today, he appears cachectic with marked muscle wasting. There is no clinical evidence of disease progression in the oropharynx, but he has palpable hepatomegaly extending 4cm below the costal margin. Chest examination reveals reduced air entry at both bases with dullness to percussion.\n\nI have discussed these findings at length with [redacted name] and his wife. Given his declining performance status and clear evidence of disease progression on first-line therapy, we have had a detailed conversation about prognosis and goals of care. He understands that his disease is no longer responding to current treatment and that his prognosis is now limited to months. We have agreed to discontinue pembrolizumab-platinum-5FU and focus on symptom management.\n\nI have made an urgent referral to the palliative care team and increased his oxycodone to 60mg BD with immediate release morphine for breakthrough pain. We will arrange community support through the district nursing team. He will be reviewed by the palliative care team next week, and I will see him again in 2 weeks to reassess his symptoms.\n?\n",
