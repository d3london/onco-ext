  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMalignant melanoma right calf\n\nManagement:\t15 Jan 2024 Wide local excision and completion lymphadenectomy\n\nHistology:\tpT4a (Breslow 4.2mm) N2M0 melanoma, BRAF V600E positive, PD-L1 75%\n\nCurrent Situation:\tCycle 3 Ipilimumab/Nivolumab immunotherapy\n\nI was very pleased to review [redacted name] in clinic today following his recent admission with immune-related colitis. He had completed two cycles of combination immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, showing excellent response with reduction in his in-transit metastases. However, he developed grade 3 colitis requiring admission on 15th March 2024, successfully managed with high-dose corticosteroids and infliximab.\n\nHe is now feeling significantly better, with complete resolution of the diarrhea and abdominal pain. His latest colonoscopy on 2nd April shows marked improvement in the colitis. His cortisol levels are appropriate on the current prednisolone taper. The in-transit metastases continue to show excellent response, with several lesions now completely resolved and others showing significant reduction in size.\n\nAfter careful discussion with [redacted name] and review at our melanoma MDT, we have decided to discontinue the ipilimumab component and continue with single-agent nivolumab. This decision balances the excellent response seen so far with the significant toxicity experienced. I have explained that single-agent nivolumab still provides excellent chance of ongoing disease control.\n\nOn examination today, his previous in-transit metastases show continued improvement. His blood tests show recovering lymphocyte count and normal liver function. We will proceed with cycle 1 of maintenance nivolumab today, with weekly blood monitoring and close clinical follow-up. I have provided detailed written information about potential immune-related adverse events and emergency contact details.\n\nThe plan is to continue with 4-weekly nivolumab, maintaining close surveillance for any recurrence of immune-related toxicity. We have arranged CT imaging prior to cycle 3 of maintenance therapy to formally assess disease response.",
