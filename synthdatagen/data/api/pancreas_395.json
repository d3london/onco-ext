Recent CT demonstrates enlarging liver metastases with several new lesions, and increase in pulmonary nodules. His performance status has significantly declined over the past 3 weeks, now spending most of the day resting. He describes worsening right upper quadrant pain requiring increased opioid doses, and new onset jaundice with dark urine over the past week. His appetite has markedly decreased with 6kg weight loss in 3 weeks.\n\nBloods show rising bilirubin at 98, ALT 156, ALP 345. CA19-9 has increased from 1200 to 3500. Given his declining performance status and liver function, I have discussed with [redacted name] and his wife that we need to stop chemotherapy. I have explained that further systemic treatment would carry significant risks with little likely benefit.\n\nI have referred urgently to the palliative care team and arranged community support. He will be reviewed by them this week. I have prescribed additional breakthrough analgesia and started dexamethasone 4mg daily. We will arrange telephone follow-up next week to ensure adequate symptom control.",
