  "content": "Diagnosis:\tRight renal mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma, pT2aN0M0\n\nManagement:\tRight radical nephrectomy 15 March 2023\n\nHistology:\tMucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma, 8.5cm, CK7 negative, margins clear\n\nCurrent Situation:\tRoutine surveillance review\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today in the renal oncology follow-up clinic. She is now 14 months post right radical nephrectomy and continues to make good progress. She has fully recovered from her surgery with complete healing of her surgical scar. Her energy levels have returned to normal and she has maintained her weight at 72kg. She denies any new symptoms of concern and specifically has no abdominal pain, haematuria, or respiratory symptoms.\n\nHer blood pressure today was 138/82 mmHg. Clinical examination was unremarkable with a well-healed surgical scar. Blood tests show stable renal function with creatinine 98 umol/L and eGFR >60. Liver function and bone profile are within normal range.\n\nSurveillance CT chest/abdomen/pelvis performed last week shows no evidence of disease recurrence. The post-surgical changes in the right renal bed remain stable, and there are no new lesions identified.\n\nThe plan is to continue surveillance as per protocol. I have arranged her next CT scan for 6 months' time and will see her back in clinic with the results. She understands to contact us sooner if she develops any new concerning symptoms.",
