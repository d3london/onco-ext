He has tolerated the treatment well with only mild local irritative symptoms lasting 24-48 hours after each instillation. No systemic symptoms or fever reported. Urinalysis today shows no evidence of infection. His most recent flexible cystoscopy on 15 March 2024 showed no visible recurrence. Blood tests remain stable with normal renal function.\n\nHe will complete the remaining 2 weeks of induction BCG therapy. We have arranged follow-up flexible cystoscopy in 6 weeks' time, followed by clinic review to discuss maintenance BCG schedule. He understands to contact us if developing fever or worsening urinary symptoms.",
