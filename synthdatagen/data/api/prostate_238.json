  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMetastatic prostate cancer with neuroendocrine transformation\n\nManagement:\tPreviously treated with ADT/docetaxel, then cabazitaxel\n\tEnrolled in Phase II NEPTUNE trial of platinum/etoposide\n\nHistology:\tInitially adenocarcinoma Gleason 4+5=9\n\tRecent biopsy confirms neuroendocrine transformation\n\nCurrent Situation:\tCycle 2 Day 8 NEPTUNE trial\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who is participating in the NEPTUNE trial of carboplatin/etoposide for neuroendocrine-transformed metastatic prostate cancer. Unfortunately, he has experienced significant deterioration since cycle 1. His headaches have worsened despite increased dexamethasone, and he describes new onset diplopia. His performance status has declined from ECOG 1 to ECOG 3, now spending most of the day in bed. He required admission last week with grade 4 neutropenia (neutrophils 0.2) and received IV antibiotics for neutropenic sepsis.\n\nThe MRI brain performed yesterday shows progression of his known cerebellar metastasis from 2.8cm to 3.5cm with increasing edema, and two new small frontal lobe lesions. His PSA remains low at 1.2 but NSE has increased from 85 to 142.\n\nOn examination today, he has new right sixth nerve palsy and ataxic gait. He is accompanied by his wife who reports he has become increasingly confused over the past 48 hours.\n\nI have discussed these findings with the trial team. Given the clear evidence of disease progression and significant decline in performance status, we have agreed to discontinue trial treatment. I have arranged urgent referral to the neuro-oncology MDT for consideration of whole brain radiotherapy, and admission today for IV dexamethasone and supportive care. I have also referred to the palliative care team for ongoing support.\n\nThe trial team will arrange the end of treatment visit and we will continue to collect survival data as per protocol. I have explained these decisions to [redacted name] and his wife, who understand and agree with the plan.",
