  "content": "Diagnosis:\nTranslocation renal cell carcinoma (TFEB rearranged) of right kidney upper pole\nStage T2N0M0 at diagnosis\n\nPrevious treatment:\nRight partial nephrectomy 15 March 2024\n\nHistology:\nTranslocation renal cell carcinoma, TFEB rearrangement confirmed on FISH testing\nTumor size 7.2cm\nNegative margins\nNo lymphovascular invasion\n\nCurrent situation:\nPost-operative review\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following his recent partial nephrectomy. He has made an excellent recovery from surgery with good wound healing and minimal post-operative pain. His renal function remains stable with creatinine 98 umol/L compared to pre-operative baseline of 92 umol/L.\n\nCT chest/abdomen/pelvis performed on 12 April 2024 shows expected post-operative changes in the right kidney upper pole with no evidence of residual or recurrent disease. No concerning features elsewhere.\n\nGiven the unusual histological subtype and size >7cm, we have discussed changing from the original surveillance plan to consideration of adjuvant immunotherapy. I have explained the rationale, potential benefits and risks of pembrolizumab in this setting. [redacted name] wishes to proceed with adjuvant treatment.\n\nPlan:\nTo commence pembrolizumab 400mg IV every 6 weeks for 9 cycles\nBaseline thyroid function, cortisol and autoimmune screen arranged\nReview in 3 weeks with results prior to cycle 1\nContinue 3-monthly CT surveillance as previously planned",
