  "content": "Diagnosis:\t\tMalignant melanoma, right forearm\n\nManagement:\t\t12 Mar 2024 Wide local excision with 1cm margins\n\nHistology:\t\tBreslow thickness 0.9mm, no ulceration, no lymphovascular invasion\n\t\tBRAF V600K mutation detected\n\t\tComplete excision with clear margins\n\nCurrent situation:\tPost-operative review\n\n[redacted name] was reviewed in the melanoma clinic today following recent wide local excision of a right forearm melanoma. The surgical site is healing well with no evidence of complications. Clinical examination shows no concerning features in the right axilla or elsewhere. Given the Breslow thickness <1mm without high-risk features, we have discussed that no adjuvant therapy is indicated at present. However, in view of the BRAF V600K mutation status, we have counselled regarding the availability of targeted therapy should this be needed in future.\n\nThe plan is for regular surveillance with 3-monthly reviews for the first year. We have provided written information about sun protection and skin self-examination. A referral has been made to our specialist melanoma nursing team for ongoing support and education.",
