  "content": "Diagnosis:\tSigmoid adenocarcinoma with micropapillary features\n\nManagement:\tAnterior resection March 2024\n\tAdjuvant FOLFOX commenced April 2024\n\nHistology:\tpT4aN2b (8/15 nodes), micropapillary adenocarcinoma\n\tMSI-high, TMB-high\n\nCurrent Situation:\tNew liver metastases identified during adjuvant treatment\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following the recent CT showing new liver lesions while on cycle 3 of adjuvant FOLFOX. The largest lesion measures 2.8cm in segment 7, with two additional sub-centimeter lesions in segment 4. Despite this finding, he remains remarkably well with PS 0 and no symptoms from the liver disease. His liver function tests remain normal and CEA has risen from 4.2 to 18.6.\n\nGiven the MSI-high status, we have discussed changing strategy to immunotherapy. I have explained the rationale for pembrolizumab monotherapy and its expected benefits in this molecular subtype. He understands this represents a change from our original adjuvant intent. We will arrange pembrolizumab funding approval and initiate treatment within 2 weeks. CT reassessment will be performed after 4 cycles.\n\nIn the meantime, I have requested an MRI liver for better characterization of disease burden and baseline measurement. The plan is to commence pembrolizumab 400mg Q6weekly once funding is approved. We will see him prior to cycle 1 with the MRI results.",
