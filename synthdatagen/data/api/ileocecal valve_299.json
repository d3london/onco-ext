CT shows stable disease in liver metastases and bone lesions. However, treatment has been complicated by cumulative myelosuppression with latest platelets 45 x 10^9/L and grade 2 fatigue affecting daily activities. Given high Ki67 of 80% and SSTR2 positivity, we have discussed switching to PRRT (Lutathera) therapy.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tGallium-68 DOTATATE PET-CT booked for 15 Apr 2024\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tNone\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up in 2 weeks with PET-CT results\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly FBC monitoring\n\n\tSummary of information given to patient\n\tDiscussed rationale for treatment change and PRRT procedure.
