Gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma T2N1M0\n\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tMarch 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tCurative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Mar 2024 Diagnostic gastroscopy and biopsy\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tNot yet commenced\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tLocalized disease with regional nodal involvement\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tIntermittent epigastric discomfort\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 62-year-old gentleman's case was discussed at today's Upper GI MDT. The diagnostic biopsy from 15/03/24 confirms a well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the gastric body. Immunohistochemistry shows strong positivity for Chromogranin A and Synaptophysin. Ki-67 index is 12%. Staging CT chest/abdomen/pelvis demonstrates a 3.2cm gastric mass with two suspicious regional lymph nodes but no evidence of distant metastatic disease. Octreotide scan shows no evidence of other disease sites.\n\nThe MDT recommendations are for curative surgical management with total gastrectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy, followed by adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy given the relatively high Ki-67 index. The case has been discussed with our NET-specialist medical oncologist [redacted name] who agrees with this approach.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tBaseline Chromogranin A, 24-hour urinary 5-HIAA\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tPPI to continue\n\n\tFollow up\n\tSurgical clinic appointment next week for consent and pre-operative assessment\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tNone at present\n\n\tSummary of information given to the patient\n\tMDT outcome will be discussed in detail at surgical clinic appointment",
