She has recovered well from treatment with improving energy levels and has regained 3kg weight. Her main ongoing issue is mild peripheral neuropathy affecting her feet, which is gradually improving. Current weight is 68kg and performance status is 0. Clinical examination shows well-healed surgical scars with no concerning features. Recent surveillance CT scan on 15/7/24 shows no evidence of disease recurrence. Blood tests including CA19-9 are within normal range. The plan is to continue 3-monthly surveillance with next CT scan due in October 2024. She will be reviewed again following those results.",
