  "content": "Diagnosis:\tLocally advanced bladder squamous cell carcinoma with bone oligometastases\n\nManagement:\t12 Mar 2024 Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT)\n\t\t20 Mar 2024 Started on Cisplatin-Gemcitabine chemotherapy\n\nHistology:\tModerately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, muscle invasive\n\t\tPD-L1 negative (CPS <1)\n\nCurrent Situation:\tPre-cycle 3 chemotherapy review\n\nI was very pleased to see [redacted name] today who attended with his wife for review before cycle 3 of chemotherapy. He has been managing remarkably well with treatment despite the initial challenges. His main symptoms at presentation - the haematuria and pelvic pain - have significantly improved since starting chemotherapy. He continues to maintain good mobility and is making excellent efforts with his nutrition and hydration as advised.\n\nHe reports grade 1 peripheral neuropathy affecting his fingertips which started after the last cycle, but this is not impacting his daily activities. There has been some altered taste sensation and mild nausea, well controlled with the prescribed antiemetics. His wife notes he has been more tired after this second cycle but is still managing his daily walks.\n\nThe recent CT scan shows stable disease in the bladder primary with no change in the T12 vertebral metastasis. The bone pain has improved significantly following the palliative radiotherapy completed in March. His renal function remains stable with creatinine clearance >60ml/min, and other blood parameters are satisfactory for continuing treatment.\n\nWe had a detailed discussion about his progress. While I'm encouraged by the symptomatic improvement and disease stabilization, we agreed to arrange an MRI spine to better evaluate the bone metastasis response. I have also requested a urology review to assess local disease status.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 3 chemotherapy today at full doses given the acceptable side effect profile. We will see him again in three weeks with the MRI results. I have provided contact details for the acute oncology service should he develop any concerning symptoms in the interim.",
