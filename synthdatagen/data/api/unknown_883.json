  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMetastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma with liver metastases\n\nManagement:\t\tCommenced Carboplatin/Etoposide March 2024\n\nHistology:\t\tPoorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma, Ki67 80%\n\nCurrent Situation:\tPost cycle 3 review\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today in the oncology follow-up clinic. She has completed three cycles of carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy with good tolerance. Her main symptoms of abdominal discomfort and early satiety have significantly improved. Recent CT scan performed on 15/5/24 shows partial response with 40% reduction in size of liver metastases. Blood tests show stable biochemistry and tumour markers trending down with Chromogranin A now 85 (previously 220).\n\nPerformance status remains 0. She reports grade 1 fatigue which is manageable, and grade 1 peripheral neuropathy affecting fingertips only. No other toxicities noted.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 4 chemotherapy today. We will arrange a progress CT after cycle 6. Follow-up appointment in 3 weeks.",
