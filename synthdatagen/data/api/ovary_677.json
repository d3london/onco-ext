  "content": "Diagnosis:\tHigh grade mixed serous and clear cell ovarian carcinoma, Stage IIIC, BRCA2 mutation positive (somatic)\n\nInitial presentation March 2023 with extensive peritoneal disease and right pleural effusion. Debulking surgery not feasible due to disease extent.\n\nReceived 6 cycles carboplatin/paclitaxel March-August 2023 with partial response. Commenced maintenance olaparib 300mg BD August 2023.\n\nUnfortunately, recent CT shows disease progression with increasing peritoneal deposits, new ascites, and enlarging right pleural effusion. CA125 has risen from 45 to 890 over 8 weeks. Performance status has declined from 1 to 2.\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today with her daughter. She reports increasing abdominal distension and early satiety. She has also developed increasing breathlessness on minimal exertion. She requires additional pillows at night and can only walk short distances. Her appetite has significantly decreased with 6kg weight loss over 2 months.\n\nOn examination, she has obvious ascites with shifting dullness and decreased breath sounds at the right base. Oxygen saturations 94% on room air. Performance status is now ECOG 2.\n\nI have discussed with [redacted name] that her disease is unfortunately progressing despite olaparib maintenance therapy. We have agreed to discontinue olaparib and commence second-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD). I have explained the common side effects including fatigue, mucositis, and palmar-plantar syndrome.\n\nPlan:\n- Discontinue olaparib today\n- Arrange pleural aspiration next week\n- Start carboplatin AUC 5 and PLD 40mg/m2 in 2 weeks pending pleural drainage\n- Referral to palliative care for symptom management\n- Review in 3 weeks with pre-chemotherapy bloods",
