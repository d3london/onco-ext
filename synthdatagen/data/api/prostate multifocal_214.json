  "content": "Diagnosis:\nLocally advanced prostate cancer\nT3b N0 M0 acinar adenocarcinoma, Gleason 4+4 (Grade Group 4)\nInitial PSA 34.5 (March 2024)\n\nPrevious medical history:\nType 2 diabetes\nHypertension\nPrevious DVT 2018\n\nCurrent medications:\nMetformin 1g BD\nRamipril 10mg OD\nApixaban 5mg BD\n\nAllergies:\nNone known\n\nCurrent situation:\nDiscussed at Uro-oncology MDT 15 April 2024\n\nImaging findings:\nMRI prostate (28 March 2024) - multifocal disease with right seminal vesicle invasion and extracapsular extension. No evidence of lymphadenopathy or bone metastases.\n\nCT CAP (2 April 2024) - no evidence of metastatic disease\n\nBone scan (5 April 2024) - no evidence of bone metastases\n\nThe case was discussed in detail at today's MDT. Given the locally advanced nature of the disease with seminal vesicle invasion, and the high-risk features (Gleason 4+4, PSA 34.5), the consensus recommendation is for combination treatment with external beam radiotherapy and long-term hormone therapy.\n\nThe proposed treatment plan is:\n1. Commence luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue therapy with 3-monthly leuprorelin, following initial anti-androgen cover\n2. External beam radiotherapy to prostate and seminal vesicles (74Gy in 37 fractions) to commence after 3-6 months of hormone therapy\n3. Continue LHRH analogue therapy for 3 years total duration\n\nI have discussed these recommendations with [redacted name] in clinic following the MDT. He understands the rationale for combined modality treatment and the expected duration of hormone therapy. We have discussed potential side effects including hot flushes, fatigue, mood changes, and potential impact on bone health. He has agreed to proceed with the recommended treatment plan.\n\nThe patient will be reviewed in the combined clinic in 4 weeks with initial PSA result and to commence hormone therapy. I have arranged baseline bone density scan and renal function tests prior to treatment initiation.",
