Small cell carcinoma of ovary, hypercalcemic type\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tCurative intent\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2024 Primary debulking surgery - total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t1. BEP protocol (Bleomycin, Etoposide, Cisplatin) commenced 12 Feb 2024\n\t2. Currently on cycle 4 of planned 6 cycles\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNot enrolled\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tStable disease on imaging\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tGrade 2 peripheral neuropathy\n\tIntermittent nausea\n\tMild tinnitus\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tReviewed today prior to cycle 4 BEP. Latest CT performed on 15/4/24 shows stable disease with no new sites of disease. Primary site changes and omental disease remain stable compared to post-operative imaging. Tumour markers remain within normal range. Performance status remains 1.\n\nTreatment tolerance has been reasonable though experiencing increasing peripheral neuropathy affecting hands and feet (grade 2). Reports ongoing intermittent nausea between cycles despite optimized antiemetics. New onset tinnitus noted but mild and non-intrusive. Blood tests today show stable renal function, normal magnesium, and adequate bone marrow reserve for cycle 4.\n\nOn examination, peripheral neuropathy confirmed with reduced vibration sense to ankles bilaterally. Abdomen soft, well-healed surgical scar. No clinical evidence of disease progression.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tRepeat CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after cycle 6\n\tAudiometry to document tinnitus\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tDomperidone 10mg TDS PRN added\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up in 3 weeks pre cycle 5\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly FBC, U&E monitoring to continue\n\tPlease monitor neuropathy symptoms",
