  "content": "Diagnosis\n\t1. T4aN2cM1 squamous cell carcinoma of oral tongue\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2024 Diagnostic biopsy\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t1. Pembrolizumab 200mg + Cisplatin 100mg/m2 + 5FU 1000mg/m2 q21 days\n\tCycle 1-3: Jan-Mar 2024\n\t2. Single agent Pembrolizumab 200mg q21 days from April 2024\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tStable disease on imaging\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Grade 2 mucositis\n\t2. Declining oral intake\n\t3. Weight loss\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\t[redacted name] attended clinic today with his wife. CT scan from 15/5/24 shows stable disease in primary tumor and metastatic sites compared to March 2024. However, he has experienced significant deterioration in oral intake over past 3 weeks due to progressive local symptoms. Weight has dropped 4kg to 62kg. Now requiring regular oral morphine solution for pain control.\n\nExamination shows extension of tumor involving right lateral tongue and floor of mouth with areas of necrosis. No airway compromise. Multiple firm right cervical nodes. PS remains 2.\n\nDiscussed case at Head & Neck MDT today. Given stable systemic disease but local progression, plan for palliative radiotherapy 30Gy in 10 fractions to oral cavity, continuing pembrolizumab during RT. Will need nasogastric feeding tube insertion prior to RT start.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tNone required\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tOramorph 10mg/5ml solution\n\n\tFollow up\n\tUrgent radiotherapy planning appointment next week\nReview in combined clinic with RT team in 2 weeks\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPlease monitor renal function and electrolytes weekly\nReferral to community palliative care team requested",
