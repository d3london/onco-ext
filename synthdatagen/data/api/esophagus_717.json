Squamous cell carcinoma of mid-esophagus T3N2M0\n\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tCurative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\tNot indicated at present\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tPlanned following completion of systemic therapy\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tCycle 3/6 of cisplatin/5FU completed 15 April 2024\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tEnrolled in SCOPE-2 trial (randomised to standard dose radiotherapy arm)\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tStable disease on interim CT assessment\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tMild dysphagia to solids only\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 62-year-old gentleman is participating in the SCOPE-2 trial for locally advanced esophageal cancer. He has completed three cycles of induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. The interim CT scan performed on 10/04/24 shows stable disease with reduction in the circumferential thickening of the mid-esophagus from 18mm to 12mm. The previously noted mediastinal nodes have also decreased in size.\n\nHe has tolerated the treatment well with only grade 1 nausea and mild fatigue. His dysphagia has improved since starting treatment and he is now able to manage a soft diet with occasional need for liquid supplements.\n\nBlood tests today show stable renal function with creatinine clearance >60ml/min and satisfactory hematological parameters for cycle 4.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tRepeat CT planned after completion of chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy phase\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tContinuing with standard antiemetic protocol\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up in 3 weeks for cycle 4\nTrial coordinator review scheduled for next week\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tNone required at present\n\n\tSummary of information given to the patient\n\tDiscussed interim scan results showing good disease response. Explained plan to complete three further cycles of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy phase as per trial protocol.",
