He has been managing relatively well on immunotherapy with stable disease noted on imaging. His main symptoms have been ongoing grade 2 fatigue and a recent onset of grade 2 colitis which has required oral steroids. His swallowing has improved significantly since starting treatment, and he is now managing a soft diet without requiring supplementary feeding.\n\nCT scan from 15 July shows stable disease in primary tumor and nodal sites, with no change in the T4 vertebral metastasis. His inflammatory markers have normalized and thyroid function remains stable.\n\nGiven the recent onset of immune-related colitis, we have agreed to pause pembrolizumab temporarily while continuing prednisolone 40mg daily with a slow taper. His diarrhea has improved from 6 episodes daily to 2-3, and abdominal pain has resolved. Once he is down to prednisolone 10mg daily with complete resolution of symptoms, we will consider restarting pembrolizumab at the same dose.\n\nThe plan is to review him again in 2 weeks with repeat bloods including cortisol and thyroid function. I have provided clear written instructions about steroid tapering and symptoms that should prompt urgent review. He understands to contact the acute oncology team if there is any deterioration in symptoms.",
