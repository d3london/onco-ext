  "content": "Diagnosis:\nMetastatic sigmoid adenocarcinoma with micropapillary features\nT4bN2M1, HER2 amplified, MSI-high\nPeritoneal metastases and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy\n\nPrevious treatment:\nJanuary 2024 - Emergency Hartmann's procedure\nFebruary-April 2024 - 4 cycles FOLFOX/Trastuzumab\n\nCurrent medications:\nOndansetron 8mg prn\nDexamethasone 4mg bd\nAprepitant protocol\n\nCurrent situation:\nCompleted cycle 4 FOLFOX/Trastuzumab\n\nCT 15 May 2024 shows stable peritoneal disease but new small volume retroperitoneal nodes\n\nCEA rising from 45 to 89\n\nPerformance status remains 1\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of 4 cycles FOLFOX/Trastuzumab. While initial response was encouraging with symptomatic improvement and CEA reduction, recent imaging shows mixed response with stable peritoneal disease but emergence of new retroperitoneal nodes. CEA has also shown upward trend. Given MSI-high status and evidence of disease progression, we will now transition to pembrolizumab monotherapy. I have explained the rationale and potential benefits of immunotherapy in detail.\n\nThe plan is to commence pembrolizumab 400mg q6weekly. First treatment scheduled for next week. We will arrange CT reassessment after 4 cycles. Blood tests including thyroid function will be monitored regularly. [redacted name] understands to report any new symptoms promptly, particularly those that might indicate immune-related adverse effects.\n\nFollow up arranged in 3 weeks with blood tests including thyroid function, liver function, and tumor markers.",
