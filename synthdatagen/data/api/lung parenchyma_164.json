Stage IVB SMARCA4-mutant lung adenocarcinoma with bone and liver metastases\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t12 Jan 2024 CT-guided lung biopsy\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\t15 Feb 2024 20Gy in 5# to T7-T9 vertebrae\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tCarboplatin/Pemetrexed commenced 20 Jan 2024\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone suitable\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tStable disease on imaging with mixed clinical picture\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tWorsening bone pain despite stable imaging\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\t[redacted name] attended clinic today for review of response to systemic therapy. CT scan performed last week shows stable disease in both liver and bone metastases, with the largest liver lesion unchanged at 4.2cm. However, she reports increasing bone pain particularly affecting her thoracic spine despite previous radiotherapy. Her mobility has declined and she now requires two walking sticks. Performance status has deteriorated to ECOG 2.\n\nBlood tests show stable biochemistry but hemoglobin has dropped to 98 g/L from 115 g/L three weeks ago. Liver function remains normal. Inflammatory markers are elevated with CRP 86.\n\nGiven the mixed picture of radiologically stable disease but clinical deterioration, we have agreed to continue carboplatin/pemetrexed for one further cycle with close monitoring. I have increased her analgesia today and arranged urgent review with the palliative care team.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tRepeat CT in 6 weeks\n\tWeekly FBC monitoring\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tOxycodone MR increased to 40mg BD\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up in 2 weeks pre-cycle 4\nPalliative care review next week\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly FBC monitoring\nPlease monitor renal function",
