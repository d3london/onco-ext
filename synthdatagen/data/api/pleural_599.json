  "content": "I was very pleased to see [redacted name] today following completion of his 6 cycles of first-line pemetrexed and cisplatin chemotherapy for his right-sided pleural mesothelioma. He has shown a remarkable response to treatment, with significant improvement in his breathlessness and chest wall pain. His initial presentation in January 2024 with right-sided chest wall pain and increasing breathlessness led to the diagnosis of epithelioid mesothelioma, with staging confirming T3N1M0 disease with chest wall invasion and ipsilateral lymph node involvement. Molecular testing showed retained BAP1 and MTAP expression.\n\nHe has managed the chemotherapy remarkably well, maintaining his independence throughout and even continuing with his regular swimming during the less intensive weeks of treatment. His main side effects have been grade 1 fatigue and occasional nausea, well controlled with standard antiemetics. His most recent CT scan on 15th June 2024 shows an excellent partial response with significant reduction in pleural thickening and resolution of the chest wall mass. His inflammatory markers have normalized, with CRP now 4 (previously 86 at diagnosis).\n\nOn examination today, his chest expansion has notably improved and there is good air entry throughout the right lung with only minimal dullness at the base. His performance status remains excellent at PS 0. His weight has stabilized at 82kg having recovered the 3kg lost at the start of treatment.\n\nWe have discussed the excellent response to treatment and I have explained that we will now move to a period of active surveillance. He understands the importance of monitoring for any new or worsening symptoms. We have arranged CT chest and abdomen for 3 months' time and will see him back in clinic with these results. I have provided him with contact details for our specialist mesothelioma nurse who will continue to support him through his surveillance period.\n?\n?\nHe remains very positive about his progress and is looking forward to a planned holiday with his family next month, now that his treatment is complete. We will see him again in September with his scan results, but he knows to contact us sooner if he develops any concerning symptoms.",
