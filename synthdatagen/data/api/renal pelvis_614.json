  "content": "Diagnosis:\tUrothelial carcinoma (micropapillary variant) of right renal pelvis, pT3N1M0\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] in follow up clinic today. She is now 6 months post completion of adjuvant gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy which finished in November 2023. She underwent right nephroureterectomy in May 2023 which showed micropapillary variant urothelial carcinoma with perinephric fat invasion and 2 positive lymph nodes.\n\nShe is feeling generally well with good energy levels. No urinary symptoms. Weight is stable. Performance status remains 0. Blood tests show stable renal function with creatinine 110, normal FBC and LFTs.\n\nHer surveillance CT chest/abdomen/pelvis from last week shows no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. The post-surgical changes in the right renal bed are stable. No new lymphadenopathy.\n\nThe plan is to continue regular surveillance. I have arranged her next CT scan for 3 months time and will see her back in clinic thereafter. She understands to contact us sooner if she develops any new symptoms of concern.",
