Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma T4bN2cM1\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\tNot suitable due to extent of disease\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\t15 Jan - 19 Feb 2024: Palliative radiotherapy 30Gy in 10# to larynx and neck\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t1. Jan-Mar 2024: 3 cycles Pembrolizumab/Cisplatin/5FU\n\t2. Apr 2024: Switch to single agent Pembrolizumab due to cisplatin-related ototoxicity\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tStable disease on imaging. Ongoing symptoms from local disease.\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Progressive dysphagia requiring NG feeding\n\t2. Grade 2 ototoxicity from previous cisplatin\n\t3. Chronic pain requiring opioid adjustment\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tReviewed today following cycle 2 of single-agent pembrolizumab. Latest CT (15/4/24) shows stable disease in primary tumor, nodal disease, and metastatic sites. Performance status remains 2. Main challenges are dysphagia requiring ongoing NG feeding and pain control. Recent pure tone audiometry confirms moderate bilateral hearing loss. Pembrolizumab well tolerated with no immune-related adverse events.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\t1. CT neck/chest/abdomen in 9 weeks\n\t2. Weekly blood tests including TFTs\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\t1. Oxycodone MR increased to 40mg BD\n\t2. Breakthrough oxycodone 10mg PRN\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology review in 3 weeks pre-cycle 3 pembrolizumab\n\tSpeech and Language review next week for swallow assessment\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly blood monitoring\nDistrict nurse support for NG feeding care\n\n\tSummary of information given to patient\n\tDiscussed stable disease status and ongoing treatment plan. Reviewed side effects of immunotherapy and alert symptoms.",
