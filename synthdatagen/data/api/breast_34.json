Inflammatory breast cancer right breast, T4dN3M1\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tMarch 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\tNot indicated due to inflammatory component and metastatic disease\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t15 March 2024 - 12 April 2024: Weekly Paclitaxel with Atezolizumab\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease with deteriorating clinical status\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tWorsening liver function, increasing dyspnoea, deteriorating performance status\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 42-year-old lady's case was discussed at today's Breast MDT following concerning clinical deterioration over the past 2 weeks. She initially presented with inflammatory breast cancer in March 2024, with widespread liver metastases. Initial treatment with weekly Paclitaxel and Atezolizumab was commenced based on high PDL1 expression (TILs 70%). Unfortunately, after 4 cycles, she has experienced clinical deterioration with worsening liver function (bilirubin rising from 24 to 89), new onset ascites requiring drainage, and increasing breathlessness at rest.\n\nThe most recent CT performed on 15/4/24 shows progressive disease with increasing size and number of liver metastases, new pleural effusions, and enlarging axillary lymphadenopathy. Her performance status has declined from ECOG 1 to ECOG 3.\n\nThe MDT recommendations, after careful review of all available options, are:\n1. Discontinue current treatment due to clear disease progression\n2. Switch to oral Capecitabine at reduced dose (75%) with careful monitoring of liver function\n3. Early palliative care involvement\n4. Consider pleural drainage if symptoms worsen\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tWeekly liver function monitoring\nRepeat CT in 6 weeks if tolerating new treatment\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tCapecitabine 75% dose to commence\nDexamethasone 8mg daily for 5 days then reduce\n\n\tFollow up\n\tUrgent oncology review in one week\nPalliative care review arranged for tomorrow\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPlease monitor liver function weekly\nPlease support palliative care referral\n\n\tSummary of information given to the patient\n\tDiscussion held with patient and family regarding poor response to initial treatment and need to change approach. They understand the palliative nature of ongoing care.",
