Thyroglobulin remains undetectable at <0.1 ng/mL. TSH is well-controlled at 0.3 mU/L on current levothyroxine dose. Neck examination shows well-healed thyroidectomy scar with no concerning features. No palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. Latest ultrasound neck from 15/12/23 showed no evidence of recurrence. The plan is to continue current levothyroxine dose and arrange repeat thyroglobulin and TSH in 6 months with follow-up appointment.",
