  "content": "Diagnosis:\tStage III mucinous adenocarcinoma of ovary with peritoneal disease\n\nManagement:\t15 Jan 2024 Primary debulking surgery - total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy\n\nHistology:\tHigh grade mucinous adenocarcinoma, HER2 positive on immunohistochemistry (3+), confirmed by FISH testing\n\nCurrent Situation:\tCycle 4 Carboplatin/Paclitaxel with Trastuzumab\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today for assessment during her combination chemotherapy. She has completed three cycles of carboplatin AUC5 and weekly paclitaxel 80mg/m2 with three-weekly trastuzumab, having commenced treatment on 12 February 2024. Overall, she is tolerating the treatment well with manageable side effects. Her main symptoms are grade 2 peripheral neuropathy affecting her fingertips and toes, which has developed over the last two cycles. She also reports ongoing fatigue, rated as grade 2, which impacts her daily activities but she remains self-caring.\n\nHer latest CT scan from 15 March 2024 shows a good partial response with significant reduction in peritoneal disease and no new sites of disease. Her CA125 has fallen from 450 at diagnosis to 85 currently. Performance status remains 1.\n\nOn examination today, her abdomen is soft and non-tender with well-healed surgical scars. There is no clinical evidence of ascites. Her blood results show stable renal function with creatinine 82, appropriate for proceeding with cycle 4. Her latest echocardiogram on 10 March 2024 shows preserved left ventricular function with ejection fraction 55%.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 4 of combination therapy today. We will arrange a repeat CT scan after cycle 6 to assess response. I have prescribed antiemetics and provided guidance about managing the peripheral neuropathy. We will see her again in three weeks for cycle 5, with blood tests and clinical assessment prior to treatment.",
