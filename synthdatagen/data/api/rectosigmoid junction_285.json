  "content": "Diagnosis:\tAdenocarcinoma of rectosigmoid junction\n\nManagement:\t15 Jan 2024 Anterior resection\n\t\tFeb-Apr 2024 Adjuvant CAPOX chemotherapy\n\nHistology:\tpT3N1(2/12)M0 moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma\n\tMMR proficient, PIK3CA E545K mutation detected\n\nCurrent Situation:\tPost completion of adjuvant chemotherapy\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of adjuvant CAPOX chemotherapy in April 2024. She has made an excellent recovery from her anterior resection performed by [redacted name] in January, with bowel function now normalized to 2-3 movements daily with good continence. The chemotherapy course was completed with only one week delay due to grade 1 neutropenia prior to cycle 6, and she experienced manageable peripheral neuropathy which is now gradually improving.\n\nOn examination today, her surgical wounds are well healed, abdomen is soft and non-tender with no concerning features. Performance status remains excellent at ECOG 0. Her latest CEA from last week remains within normal range at 2.4 μg/L.\n\nWe have discussed the surveillance plan, which will involve 3-monthly CEA measurements and 6-monthly CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for the first two years. I have arranged her next clinic review for 3 months with CEA measurement, and CT scan will be due in October 2024. She understands to contact us sooner if she develops any new concerning symptoms in the interim.",
