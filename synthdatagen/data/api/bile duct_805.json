The second cycle was better tolerated than the first, with improvement in the grade 2 fatigue previously reported. Performance status remains 1. The mild peripheral neuropathy affecting fingers has not worsened. Blood tests show stable liver function and improving tumor markers.\n\nOn examination, surgical wounds are well healed. No evidence of disease recurrence. Weight stable at 72kg.\n\nPlan:\n1. Proceed with cycle 3 trastuzumab-deruxtecan today\n2. Continue monthly CA19-9 monitoring\n3. Next CT scan due after cycle 4\n4. Review in 3 weeks with blood tests\n5. Trial-specific quality of life questionnaires completed today",
