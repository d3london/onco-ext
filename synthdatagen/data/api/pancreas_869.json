The treatment has been well tolerated with only grade 1 fatigue and minimal nausea. Somatostatin levels have normalized from the pre-operative value of >50x ULN to now being within normal range. Latest CT imaging on 15/5/24 shows no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. Performance status remains excellent at PS0.\n\nThe plan is to move to 3-monthly surveillance with alternating CT imaging and MRI pancreas protocol. Somatostatin levels will be checked at each visit. First follow-up arranged for August 2024 with CT chest/abdomen/pelvis. I have provided written information about surveillance protocol and symptoms that should prompt earlier review. [redacted name] has been referred to our survivorship program for ongoing support.",
