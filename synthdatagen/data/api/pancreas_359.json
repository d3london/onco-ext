CT performed on 15/4/24 shows stable disease in both pancreatic primary and liver metastases, with no new sites of disease. Performance status remains 1. Main issues are grade 2 peripheral neuropathy affecting fingers and toes, and intermittent diarrhea managed with loperamide. Blood tests show stable liver function and CA19-9 has decreased from 1200 to 450.\n\nPlan to continue with cycle 4 today at current doses. Will arrange repeat CT after cycle 6 and review in 3 weeks with blood tests. Have prescribed additional antiemetics and provided guidance on managing diarrhea.",
