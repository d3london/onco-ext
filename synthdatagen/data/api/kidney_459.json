He has made an excellent recovery from surgery with complete wound healing and no complications. His post-operative pain has fully resolved and he has returned to his usual activities. Recent blood tests show stable renal function with creatinine 98 umol/L. CT scan performed on 12 April 2024 shows expected post-surgical changes in the left kidney with no evidence of disease recurrence. The right kidney appears normal. No concerning features on clinical examination today. He remains well with stable weight and good appetite. The plan is to continue surveillance with repeat CT in 6 months and clinical review thereafter. Blood tests including renal function to be checked prior to next appointment.",
