She has made an excellent recovery from her surgery and subsequent chemotherapy. Her post-treatment CT scan on 15/6/24 shows no evidence of disease recurrence. Her CA19-9 has normalized at 12 U/mL. Her weight has stabilized at 68kg and appetite continues to improve. She reports mild peripheral neuropathy affecting her fingertips only, which is gradually improving. Her pancreatic enzyme replacement is well-optimized with no symptoms of malabsorption. The plan is for ongoing 3-monthly surveillance with next CT scan and CA19-9 due in September 2024. She will be reviewed in clinic following these investigations.",
