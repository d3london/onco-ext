  "content": "Diagnosis:\tLocally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma, stage T3N2M0 (AJCC 8th edition)\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of his neoadjuvant FLOT chemotherapy regimen. He has shown an excellent clinical response to treatment, with significant improvement in his dysphagia symptoms and regaining 4kg of weight over the past 8 weeks. His initial presentation in January 2024 was with a 5cm mid-esophageal adenocarcinoma with regional nodal involvement. Molecular profiling demonstrated FGFR2 amplification and PD-L1 CPS of 15.\n\nHe completed 4 cycles of FLOT chemotherapy from February to April 2024 with good tolerance. His recent endoscopy on 15 April 2024 showed significant macroscopic regression of the primary tumor, and repeat CT staging on 20 April 2024 demonstrated partial response with reduction in primary tumor size to 2.8cm and resolution of previously noted regional lymphadenopathy.\n\nGiven his excellent response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, I have discussed his case at our Upper GI MDT on 22 April 2024. The consensus recommendation is to proceed with surgical resection. I have had a detailed discussion with [redacted name] and his wife regarding the change in treatment approach from chemotherapy to surgery. They understand the rationale for surgery at this point and the potential risks and benefits.\n\nI have arranged for him to see our Upper GI surgical team next week. We will then see him again in the oncology clinic following his post-operative recovery to discuss the potential role of adjuvant therapy based on his final pathological staging. His FGFR2 amplification status may also guide potential targeted therapy options in the adjuvant setting.",
