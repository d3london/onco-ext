She continues to tolerate Letrozole well with only mild joint stiffness in the mornings which improves with regular exercise. She has maintained good compliance with her medication and understands the importance of completing 5 years of endocrine therapy. Her energy levels have improved significantly since completing radiotherapy, and she has returned to her regular swimming activities three times per week.\n\nOn examination today, the left breast shows excellent cosmetic outcome with well-healed surgical scar. There is no lymphadenopathy and no clinical evidence of recurrence. Recent mammogram in February 2024 showed post-treatment changes only with no suspicious features.\n\nThe plan is to continue with current endocrine therapy and arrange routine follow-up mammogram in 12 months. We will review her again in the breast clinic in 6 months. She understands to contact the breast care nurses if she develops any new concerns in the interim.",
