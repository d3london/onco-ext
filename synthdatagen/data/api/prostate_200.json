PSA has shown excellent response, dropping from 34.2 to 2.1. Testosterone remains suppressed at <0.3. He has experienced grade 2 peripheral neuropathy affecting his feet, requiring dose reduction to 60mg/m2 from cycle 4. Other toxicities include grade 1 fatigue and occasional hot flushes from ADT. Performance status remains 1. Trial-mandated QoL questionnaires completed today show stable scores. Blood results are acceptable for proceeding with cycle 5 docetaxel. Trial-specific bone density scan completed yesterday shows T-score -1.2 at hip. Plan to proceed with cycle 5 today at reduced dose. Will arrange trial-mandated CT assessment after cycle 6. Next review in 3 weeks with trial team.",
