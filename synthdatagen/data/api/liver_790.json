He has made an excellent recovery from surgery with minimal post-operative pain now controlled with regular paracetamol only. His wound has healed well with no evidence of infection. Liver function tests show expected mild derangement with ALT 82, bilirubin 28, albumin 32. Latest AFP has decreased to 42 ng/mL (from pre-operative 300 ng/mL). Performance status is 1.\n\nOn examination, wound sites are well healed. Abdomen is soft and non-tender with no evidence of ascites. No peripheral edema noted.\n\nThe plan is for 3-monthly surveillance with AFP monitoring and liver ultrasound, alternating with CT scanning. First follow-up CT is scheduled for June 2024. We will review him again in clinic with these results.",
