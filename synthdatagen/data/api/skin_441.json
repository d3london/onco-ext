  "content": "Diagnosis:\nMerkel cell carcinoma right forearm with lung metastases\nInitial surgery March 2023 - wide local excision and SLNB positive\nMCPyV negative, PD-L1 expression <1%\n\nPrevious medical history:\nType 2 diabetes\nHypertension\nChronic kidney disease stage 3\n\nCurrent medications:\nAvelumab 800mg q2weekly (on hold)\nMetformin\nRamipril\n\nCurrent situation:\nProgressive disease on imaging\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following recent CT imaging. Unfortunately, this has shown clear progression of pulmonary metastases with increase in size and number of nodules. The largest right upper lobe lesion has increased from 2.1cm to 3.4cm, with multiple new sub-centimeter nodules throughout both lung fields. This corresponds with increasing breathlessness over the past 3 weeks, now limiting walking distance to around 100m (PS 2-3).\n\nAvelumab immunotherapy was suspended 2 weeks ago due to grade 3 pneumonitis requiring hospital admission and high-dose steroids. While the pneumonitis has improved on prednisolone 40mg daily, given the clear disease progression, we will not be restarting avelumab.\n\nI have discussed the situation in detail with [redacted name] and family. Given the rapid progression and poor PD-L1 status, we have agreed to commence chemotherapy with carboplatin/etoposide. I have explained the aims are palliative, focusing on disease control and symptom improvement. We will arrange to start treatment next week, once prednisolone is reduced to 20mg daily.\n\nPlan:\n1. Start carboplatin AUC 5 / etoposide 100mg/m2 D1-3 q21 days\n2. Continue prednisolone taper as planned\n3. Arrange urgent palliative care review for symptom management\n4. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after 2 cycles\n5. Review in 3 weeks with blood tests",
