  "content": "Diagnosis:\tProstate adenocarcinoma with Paneth cell-like differentiation, T3a N0 M0\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today for assessment during his hormone therapy. He completed 6 weeks of radical radiotherapy in combination with androgen deprivation therapy on 15 March 2024. His initial PSA at diagnosis was 18.9 in September 2023, which has now fallen to 0.4. He is tolerating the hormone therapy reasonably well with only mild hot flushes and minimal fatigue. His mood remains good and he continues his regular walking routine.\n\nOn examination today, his performance status is 0. Blood pressure is 138/82. Digital rectal examination shows no concerning features.\n\nHis testosterone level is appropriately suppressed at <0.3nmol/L. Latest blood tests show normal renal and liver function. I have arranged his next PSA check for 6 weeks' time.\n\nThe plan is to continue with his current Prostap (leuprorelin) injections for a total of 2 years as previously discussed. His next injection is due on 2 May 2024. We will review him again in clinic in 3 months with his PSA trend.",
