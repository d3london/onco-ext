He has shown an encouraging partial response on recent imaging with reduction in pleural thickening and associated volume loss. His breathlessness has significantly improved and he no longer requires supplemental oxygen at rest. He has tolerated treatment well with only grade 1 fatigue and occasional nausea well controlled with standard antiemetics. Blood tests today show stable renal function and adequate haematological parameters for cycle 5.\n\nOn examination, there is improved air entry at the left base compared to previous reviews. His weight has remained stable at 72kg. Recent CT thorax from 15th April 2024 confirms partial response with reduction in pleural thickening particularly at the left base and lingula. No new sites of disease were identified.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 5 chemotherapy today. We will arrange a progress CT scan after completion of cycle 6. Follow-up appointment will be arranged for 3 weeks' time to review prior to final cycle.",
