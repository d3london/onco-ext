  "content": "Diagnosis:\tSmall cell carcinoma of bladder, stage II (T2N0M0)\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of 4 cycles of carboplatin/etoposide chemotherapy. Recent cystoscopy on 15/4/24 shows excellent response with no visible residual disease. CT thorax/abdomen/pelvis performed on 18/4/24 confirms complete radiological response.\n\nHe has tolerated treatment relatively well with grade 2 fatigue and occasional nausea, now resolved. Blood counts and renal function remain stable. Performance status is 1.\n\nGiven the excellent response to chemotherapy and the limited stage disease, we have discussed proceeding with consolidation radiotherapy to the bladder. I have explained the rationale, procedure and potential side effects. [redacted name] is keen to proceed.\n\nI have therefore referred him to Dr [redacted name] in Clinical Oncology for radiotherapy planning. We will see him again in combined clinic after completion of radiotherapy to plan ongoing surveillance. Please contact us if there are any concerns in the interim.",
