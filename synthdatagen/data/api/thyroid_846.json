She remains well with no concerning symptoms. Her TSH is appropriately suppressed at 0.1 on Levothyroxine 150mcg daily. Thyroglobulin remains undetectable at <0.1. Neck examination shows well-healed thyroidectomy scar with no palpable abnormalities. Recent ultrasound neck (15/4/24) confirms no suspicious features. She will continue current dose of Levothyroxine and we will see her in 6 months with repeat thyroglobulin and TSH. Ultrasound surveillance will continue annually.",
