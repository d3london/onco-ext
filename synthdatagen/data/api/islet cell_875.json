The treatment was generally well tolerated with only grade 1 hand-foot syndrome which has now resolved.\n?\nSerum gastrin has normalized from pre-operative level of 1200 pg/mL to current 85 pg/mL. Recent CT shows no evidence of residual or recurrent disease. Performance status remains excellent at ECOG 0.\n?\nThe plan is for 3-monthly surveillance with gastrin levels and imaging at 6 months. I have provided written information about surveillance schedule and symptoms to watch for. We will review again in clinic in 3 months with blood results.",
