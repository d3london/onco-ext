  "content": "Diagnosis:\t\tLocally advanced right lung cancer with malignant pleural effusion\n\nStage:\t\tT4N2M0\n\nBiomarkers:\tPD-L1 70%\n\nTreatment:\tCycle 3 pembrolizumab-carboplatin-pemetrexed\n\nCurrent situation:\tPre-cycle 4 review\n\n[redacted name] has attended for review prior to cycle 4 chemotherapy. Unfortunately, there has been clinical deterioration since last review with worsening breathlessness and increasing oxygen requirements. Performance status has declined to ECOG 2-3. CT performed on 15/4/24 shows increase in right pleural effusion with compression collapse of right lower lobe, though stable mediastinal nodes.\n\nUrgent pleural aspiration was performed yesterday removing 1.2L fluid with symptomatic improvement. Blood results show rising inflammatory markers with CRP 156, though other parameters remain adequate for treatment. Given clinical deterioration and radiological progression, we will discontinue current systemic therapy. I have arranged urgent palliative care review and pleural team assessment for consideration of indwelling pleural catheter. Will review in 2 weeks with repeat imaging.",
