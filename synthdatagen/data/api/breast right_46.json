  "content": "I was very pleased to see [redacted name] today for her end of treatment review following completion of adjuvant chemotherapy and targeted therapy for her early breast cancer. As you will recall, she was diagnosed in January 2024 with a 1.8cm right breast cancer, confirmed as a grade 2 papillary carcinoma on core biopsy. Final surgical pathology from her wide local excision on February 15th 2024 showed a completely excised pT1c tumour with clear margins and no lymph node involvement from the sentinel node biopsy. The tumour was confirmed as androgen receptor positive, oestrogen receptor negative, and HER2 positive (3+), with a PDL1 CPS score of 85%.\n\nShe has done remarkably well through her treatment journey, completing 4 cycles of docetaxel/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy with concurrent trastuzumab. The final cycle was completed on May 1st 2024, and she has shown admirable resilience throughout. While she experienced the expected temporary hair loss and some grade 1 fatigue, she maintained her work as a part-time teacher throughout treatment, only taking days off around her chemotherapy dates. Her cardiac function has remained stable with latest echocardiogram showing preserved ejection fraction at 58%.\n\nOn review today, she is feeling significantly better with improving energy levels and early signs of hair regrowth. She has maintained her weight and describes good appetite. She will continue single agent trastuzumab to complete a full year of HER2-directed therapy, with the final dose planned for February 2025. I have arranged for her port-a-cath removal next week as she is happy to continue with peripheral cannulation for her remaining treatment.\n\nThe plan going forward is for clinical review every 3 months during her remaining trastuzumab treatment, with cardiac monitoring every 4 months. She will then transition to 6-monthly follow up for years 2-5. Annual mammography will commence from October 2024. I have provided written information about potential late effects of treatment and symptoms that should prompt early review. She understands to contact our team if she develops any new concerning symptoms between appointments.",
