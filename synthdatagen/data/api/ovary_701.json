Clear cell carcinoma of ovary with liver metastases\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2024 Diagnostic laparoscopy and biopsy\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tCarboplatin/Paclitaxel - 2 cycles completed with disease progression\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tPhase II CLARITY trial - ARID1A-targeted therapy vs standard of care\n\tRandomised to experimental arm March 2024\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease in liver\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tFatigue, abdominal pain, early satiety\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tReviewed today for cycle 2 assessment on CLARITY trial. Unfortunately, CT performed on 15/4/24 shows significant progression of liver metastases with largest lesion increasing from 4.2cm to 6.8cm. New ascites noted. Trial-specific quality of life scores show deterioration, particularly in domains of fatigue and appetite. Performance status has declined to ECOG 2.\n\nTrial-specific blood samples collected today show grade 2 transaminitis (ALT 187, AST 165). Previous grade 1 nausea now adequately controlled with additional domperidone.\n\nGiven clear evidence of disease progression on imaging and clinical deterioration, we have made the decision to discontinue trial treatment as per protocol. Patient and family in agreement.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tRepeat CT in 2 weeks to establish new baseline\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tDomperidone 10mg TDS\n\n\tFollow up\n\tUrgent appointment arranged in general oncology clinic next week to discuss standard second-line treatment options\n\n\tRequired actions\n\tTrial discontinuation forms completed\nTrial samples processed as per protocol\nUrgent referral to palliative care team",
