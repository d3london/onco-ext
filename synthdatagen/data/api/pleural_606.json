Desmoplastic mesothelioma of right pleura\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tMarch 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\tNone - new diagnosis\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tExtensive right pleural disease with chest wall invasion\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tProgressive breathlessness\nRight-sided chest pain\nWeight loss of 6kg in 3 months\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\t[redacted name] is a 72-year-old retired plumber with significant asbestos exposure who presents with a 4-month history of progressive breathlessness and right-sided chest pain. CT thorax performed on 15/3/24 showed extensive right pleural thickening with chest wall invasion. CT-guided biopsy on 20/3/24 confirmed desmoplastic mesothelioma, with immunohistochemistry positive for CD31 and Calretinin.\n\nOn examination today, performance status is 2. There is significantly reduced air entry on the right side with dull percussion note. Oxygen saturations 92% on room air. Weight 68kg (down from 74kg in December 2023).\n\nGiven the extent of disease and performance status, we have discussed treatment options focusing on symptom control and palliative chemotherapy with Pemetrexed/Cisplatin. Patient wishes to consider this and will return next week for final decision.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tBaseline cardiac echo\nRenal function and EDTA clearance\nPET-CT for disease extent\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tMST 10mg BD\nOxycodone 5mg PRN\nPregabalin 75mg BD\n\n\tFollow up\n\tReview in one week with investigation results to confirm treatment plan\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPlease monitor renal function\nConsider referral to community palliative care team",
