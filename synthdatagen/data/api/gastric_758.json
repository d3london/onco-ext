  "content": "Diagnosis:\tLocally advanced gastric cancer - poorly cohesive carcinoma, stage T3N2M0, MSI-high, EBV positive.\n\nInitial treatment with perioperative FLOT chemotherapy commenced January 2024. Completed 4 cycles pre-operative chemotherapy with good radiological response. Underwent total gastrectomy on 15 April 2024 with D2 lymphadenectomy.\n\nPathology confirmed ypT2N1(2/15) poorly cohesive carcinoma, R0 resection. Commenced post-operative FLOT May 2024.\n\nSeen today prior to cycle 3 of post-operative chemotherapy. Tolerating treatment well with only grade 1 fatigue and mild peripheral neuropathy. Weight stable at 72kg. Performance status remains 0. Blood results satisfactory for proceeding with treatment.\n\nExamination shows well-healed surgical scars. No concerning clinical findings.\n\nPlan to proceed with cycle 3 post-operative FLOT today. Will arrange CT scan after completion of adjuvant treatment. Review in 3 weeks prior to cycle 4.",
