  "content": "Diagnosis:\nCarcinosarcoma of endometrium, stage T2N1M0, diagnosed March 2024\nTP53 mutation positive, p53 abnormal on immunohistochemistry\n\nPrevious Treatment:\nTotal abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 15 March 2024\nCommenced carboplatin/paclitaxel 12 April 2024\n\nCurrent Status:\nDisease progression on imaging after 2 cycles of chemotherapy\n\nCurrent Symptoms:\nIncreasing pelvic pain\nNew onset right leg swelling\nECOG performance status deteriorated to 2\n\nInvestigation Results:\nCT pelvis 15 May 2024 shows new 4.2cm pelvic mass with right external iliac lymphadenopathy causing venous compression\n\nCurrent Plan:\nDiscussed at Gynae-oncology MDT 16 May 2024\nRecommendation to switch to second-line treatment with Doxorubicin\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today to discuss disease progression and treatment changes. She was accompanied by her daughter. The CT scan unfortunately shows clear evidence of disease progression despite initial chemotherapy, with a new pelvic mass and lymphadenopathy causing venous compression. This explains her increasing pelvic pain and right leg swelling. Her performance status has deteriorated, though she remains suitable for second-line treatment.\n\nI have had a detailed discussion about switching to single-agent Doxorubicin. We discussed the aims of treatment, potential side effects including cardiac toxicity, and the importance of managing her symptoms. She understands this represents a significant change in her disease trajectory but wishes to proceed with further treatment.\n\nPlan:\nCommence Doxorubicin 60mg/m2 three-weekly\nUrgent referral to lymphoedema service\nBaseline echocardiogram arranged\nReview in 3 weeks with blood tests\nPalliative care team referral for enhanced symptom support",
