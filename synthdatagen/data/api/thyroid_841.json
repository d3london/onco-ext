The treatment was well tolerated with only mild temporary symptoms of dry mouth and slight nausea which have now resolved. Thyroglobulin levels have appropriately decreased post ablation from 4.2 to 0.8. TSH is well suppressed at <0.01 on current levothyroxine dose.\n\nExamination shows well-healed thyroidectomy scar. No cervical lymphadenopathy. Performance status 0.\n\nPost-treatment whole body scan shows no evidence of residual thyroid tissue or metastatic disease. The plan is for ongoing TSH suppression with current levothyroxine dose and surveillance with 6-monthly thyroglobulin measurements. Next clinic review will be in 6 months with thyroid function tests and thyroglobulin level. Annual neck ultrasound will be arranged.",
