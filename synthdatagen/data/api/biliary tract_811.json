Severe fatigue\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 62-year-old gentleman has unfortunately shown disease progression despite two lines of systemic therapy. Recent CT on 15/5/24 shows increasing liver metastases with new peritoneal deposits and malignant ascites. His performance status has declined to ECOG 3, spending >50% of time in bed. Liver function shows progressive deterioration with bilirubin 85, ALT 156, ALP 445. He requires weekly paracentesis for symptomatic ascites.\n\nAfter detailed discussion with [redacted name] and family, we have agreed to discontinue systemic anti-cancer therapy and focus on symptom control. He understands the poor prognosis but maintains good understanding and engagement in care decisions.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tWeekly monitoring of liver function\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tDexamethasone 4mg daily\n\tFurosemide 40mg daily\n\tOxycodone MR 30mg BD\n\n\tFollow up\n\tReferred to palliative care team\nWeekly ascites drainage clinic\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPlease monitor liver function weekly\nPrescribe breakthrough analgesia as needed\nDS1500 completed today",
