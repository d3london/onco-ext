She has made an excellent recovery from surgery with good wound healing. The histology confirmed a 1.8cm Grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma, ER 95% PR 90% HER2 negative (1+), with clear margins and 0/3 sentinel nodes involved. She commenced letrozole in February and is tolerating this well with only mild joint stiffness in the mornings which improves with activity. She remains active, walking daily, and has returned to work part-time.\n\nOn examination today, her left breast surgical site shows neat healing with no concerns. There is no lymphadenopathy and no clinical evidence of recurrence.\n\nThe plan is to continue letrozole and arrange annual mammogram surveillance. She will be reviewed again in clinic in 6 months' time. She understands to contact the breast care nurses if she develops any new concerns in the interim.",
