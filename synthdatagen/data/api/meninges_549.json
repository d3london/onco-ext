  "content": "Diagnosis:\nWHO Grade I meningioma, right frontal convexity\nDiagnosed March 2023 following seizure\nSubtotal resection April 2023\n\nPrevious medical history:\nMigraine\nHypertension\n\nCurrent medications:\nLevetiracetam 500mg twice daily\nPropranolol 80mg daily\n\nCurrent situation:\nRoutine surveillance MRI brain 15 March 2024\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] in the neuro-oncology surveillance clinic today. She remains seizure-free on current anti-epileptic medication and reports no new neurological symptoms. Her last headache was 2 months ago, well controlled with usual migraine medication. Performance status remains 0.\n\nSurveillance MRI brain shows stable appearances of the residual right frontal convexity meningioma measuring 1.8 x 1.2cm, unchanged from previous imaging. There is no evidence of disease progression.\n\nThe plan is to continue current management with annual MRI surveillance. I have arranged follow up in 12 months with repeat MRI brain one month before. She understands to contact us sooner if any new symptoms develop.",
