Omentum negative. 0/12 nodes involved.\n\nCurrent situation:\tPost-operative review prior to adjuvant treatment\n\n[redacted name] attended clinic today following her recent surgery. She has made an excellent recovery with good wound healing and is now back to her baseline mobility. Her post-operative pain has largely resolved and she is managing well at home with her husband's support. Performance status is 0.\n\nWe discussed the role of adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. She understands the aims of treatment and the common side effects. She is keen to proceed.\n\nPlan is to commence chemotherapy in 2 weeks' time. We will arrange baseline blood tests, ECG, and staging CT chest/abdomen/pelvis prior to treatment start. Follow-up arranged for 3 weeks' time to review after first cycle.",
