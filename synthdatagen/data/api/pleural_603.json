  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMalignant pleural mesothelioma with widespread metastatic disease\n\nManagement:\tFirst-line Cisplatin/Pemetrexed completed March 2024\n\tSecond-line Gemcitabine commenced April 2024\n\nHistology:\tEpitheloid mesothelioma, MTAP loss, WT1 positive\n\nCurrent Situation:\tReview during cycle 2 Gemcitabine\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following commencement of second-line chemotherapy with single-agent Gemcitabine. The transition to second-line treatment was necessitated by disease progression on first-line therapy, though this had initially achieved disease stability for 4 months. The current regimen was selected in view of his maintained performance status and preference for active treatment.\n\nHis tolerance of Gemcitabine has been notably better than the previous platinum-based regime. The significant fatigue and grade 2 peripheral neuropathy that had developed during first-line treatment have improved considerably. He reports only mild fatigue now, mainly in the days immediately following treatment. His exercise tolerance has improved, and he is managing daily walks of increasing distance. The previous right-sided chest pain has remained well controlled on regular paracetamol and modified-release morphine.\n\nCT imaging from last week shows stable disease compared to pre-treatment baseline, with no new sites of disease identified. The main right pleural mass measures 8.2cm compared to 8.4cm previously, with stable appearance of chest wall invasion and mediastinal nodal disease. The small volume peritoneal deposits are unchanged.\n\nOn examination today, chest signs are stable with reduced air entry and dullness to percussion at the right base. His performance status remains 1. Blood tests show stable renal function and acceptable haematological parameters for continuation of treatment.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 3 of Gemcitabine next week. We will arrange a progress CT scan after cycle 4 to formally assess disease response. I have also referred him to our palliative care team for ongoing support with symptom management, though his symptoms are currently well controlled. We will review him again in clinic in 3 weeks' time.",
