  "content": "Diagnosis:\tProstate cancer - T2aN0M0 acinar adenocarcinoma diagnosed March 2023\n\tGleason 3+3 (Grade Group 1), initial PSA 4.2\n\tActive surveillance protocol\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] in follow-up clinic today. He remains well on the active surveillance protocol with no new urological symptoms. His latest PSA from 15/4/24 is 4.1, showing continued stability from previous readings (4.2 in March 2023, 4.0 in September 2023, 4.2 in January 2024). Digital rectal examination shows a small, firm nodule in the right peripheral zone, unchanged from previous examinations.\n\nHe continues to void well with good flow and no nocturia. His International Prostate Symptom Score remains stable at 6/35. He maintains good functional status and has recently increased his walking to 5km daily.\n\nThe plan is to continue on the active surveillance protocol. His next PSA is due in 3 months, with MRI prostate scheduled for September 2024 as per protocol. He will be reviewed in clinic following these investigations. I have provided written information about PSA monitoring and symptoms that should prompt earlier review.",
