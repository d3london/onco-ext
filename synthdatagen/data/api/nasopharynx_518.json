  "content": "Diagnosis\n\t1. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (undifferentiated, EBV positive)\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\tNot indicated\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\t15 Jan - 20 Feb 2024: Radical chemoradiotherapy to nasopharynx and neck (70Gy in 35#)\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t1. Concurrent cisplatin 100mg/m2 q3weekly with radiotherapy (2 cycles completed, 3rd omitted due to deteriorating renal function)\n\t2. Palliative carboplatin/gemcitabine commenced March 2024\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease with new pulmonary metastases and increasing bone metastases\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Worsening bone pain\n\t2. Progressive dyspnoea\n\t3. Deteriorating renal function\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who attended with his wife. Unfortunately, his recent CT scan from 15/4/24 shows clear evidence of disease progression with new pulmonary metastases and increasing size and number of bone metastases, particularly affecting T4-T6 vertebrae and left acetabulum. This correlates with his worsening symptoms of bone pain and increasing breathlessness.\n\nHe has completed two cycles of carboplatin/gemcitabine but with limited tolerance - grade 3 thrombocytopenia requiring two platelet transfusions and one episode of neutropenic sepsis requiring hospital admission. His renal function has deteriorated with eGFR now 38 (baseline 65).\n\nPerformance status has declined to ECOG 2-3, spending approximately 50% of the day resting. He requires regular breakthrough oxycodone for bone pain despite being on MST 60mg BD. His wife reports he is sleeping poorly due to pain.\n\nGiven the clear evidence of disease progression and poor tolerance of current chemotherapy, we have had a detailed discussion about changing approach. His PDL1 status (CPS 35) supports use of immunotherapy. We have agreed to commence pembrolizumab monotherapy with concurrent denosumab for bone metastases.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tUrgent MRI spine to assess for cord compression\n\tBaseline thyroid function and cortisol prior to immunotherapy\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tPembrolizumab 200mg q3weekly\n\tDenosumab 120mg q4weekly\n\tIncreased MST to 90mg BD\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology review in 2 weeks prior to cycle 1 pembrolizumab\n\tUrgent palliative care referral made\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly monitoring of renal function\n\tPlease prescribe laxatives for opiate-induced constipation",
