She has recovered well from her surgery with good wound healing. The surgical scar on the right upper arm is well-healed with no concerning features. There is no palpable lymphadenopathy in the right axilla. No new skin lesions identified on full skin examination today.\n\nHer latest chest x-ray from 15/4/24 shows no evidence of metastatic disease. Blood tests including LDH remain within normal range.\n\nI have provided education regarding sun protection and skin self-examination. She will continue with 3-monthly surveillance visits for the first year. I have arranged follow-up in the melanoma clinic in 3 months with repeat blood tests including LDH. She understands to contact us sooner if she develops any new concerning symptoms or skin changes.",
