  "content": "Diagnosis:\tProstate adenocarcinoma with micropapillary features\n\tT3b N0 M0, Gleason 4+4=8\n\tDiagnosed March 2024\n\tInitial PSA 28.6\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who is currently receiving androgen deprivation therapy with Leuprorelin, having completed his course of radical radiotherapy in May 2024. He has responded well to treatment with his PSA now down to 0.8 from the initial level of 28.6. The patient reports good energy levels and has maintained his usual activities including regular swimming and gardening. He describes some mild hot flushes which he is managing well without requiring additional intervention.\n\nHis prostate examination today shows reduction in the previous abnormality, and there are no concerning features. Blood pressure is stable at 138/82. Recent blood tests show testosterone remains adequately suppressed at <0.7 nmol/L, liver function and renal function are normal.\n\nWe have discussed the plan to continue with Leuprorelin for a total of 3 years as per protocol, given his high-risk disease features. I have explained that we will monitor his PSA every 3 months initially, extending to 6-monthly if remains stable. He understands to contact us if he develops any new symptoms in the interim.\n\nI will arrange repeat blood tests including PSA, testosterone, and bone profile in 3 months' time. We will review him again in clinic following these results.",
