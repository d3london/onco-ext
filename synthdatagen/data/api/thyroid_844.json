She remains well following completion of treatment last year. Her thyroid function is well controlled on levothyroxine 125mcg daily. Thyroglobulin remains undetectable at <0.1. Recent neck ultrasound on 15/4/24 shows no evidence of recurrence. Clinical examination today reveals well-healed thyroidectomy scar and no concerning features in the neck. She reports good energy levels and has maintained stable weight. The plan is to continue current surveillance with next thyroglobulin check in 3 months and follow-up appointment in 6 months.",
