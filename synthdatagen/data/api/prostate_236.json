Prostate adenocarcinoma with glomeruloid features\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tMarch 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tCurative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Mar 2024 Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tNot yet commenced\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tNot indicated\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tLocalized disease\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tMild lower urinary tract symptoms\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 64-year-old gentleman was referred following detection of rising PSA, which reached 6.4 ng/mL in February 2024. Subsequent prostate biopsy on 15/03/24 confirmed adenocarcinoma with glomeruloid features, Gleason 3+4=7 (Grade Group 2), involving 4 of 12 cores from the right peripheral zone. Clinical stage T2a. MRI prostate shows a 1.2cm PIRADS 4 lesion in the right peripheral zone with no evidence of extraprostatic extension. Bone scan shows no evidence of metastatic disease. Molecular testing has identified FOXA1 mutation.\n\nHe reports mild lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score of 8/35. Performance status is 0. He is otherwise fit and well with no significant comorbidities.\n\nWe have discussed management options including radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy with hormonal therapy. He expressed a preference for radiotherapy treatment.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tBaseline renal function and testosterone level\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tNone\n\n\tFollow up\n\tRadiotherapy planning appointment in 2 weeks\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tNone required\n\n\tSummary of information given to the patient\n\tDiscussed diagnosis, staging and treatment options. Written information provided regarding radiotherapy treatment. Contact details given for clinical nurse specialist.",
