He is recovering well with no concerning symptoms. His ileal conduit is functioning appropriately with good urine output. Blood tests show stable renal function with creatinine 98. CT scan performed last week shows no evidence of recurrence. His weight is stable at 72kg and appetite has improved. Performance status remains 1. On examination, stoma site is well-healed with no parastomal herniation. The plan is to continue surveillance with next CT chest/abdomen/pelvis in 3 months and clinic review thereafter. Blood tests including renal function to be checked prior to next appointment.",
