She has recovered well from her operation with no ongoing symptoms. Her weight is stable and appetite good. She denies any abdominal pain, change in bowel habit, or flushing symptoms. Blood tests show normal Chromogranin A at 56 pmol/L (range 0-60). Recent CT scan on 15/4/24 shows post-surgical changes only with no evidence of recurrence.\n\nOn examination today, her surgical wounds are well healed. Abdomen is soft and non-tender with no masses. She remains clinically well.\n\nThe plan is to continue surveillance with 6-monthly Chromogranin A measurements and annual CT scanning. I will review her again in clinic in 6 months with repeat blood tests. She understands to contact us sooner if she develops any new symptoms of concern.",
