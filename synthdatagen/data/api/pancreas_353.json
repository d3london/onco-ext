  "content": "Diagnosis\n\t1. Mixed ductal-acinar carcinoma of pancreas, Stage III at diagnosis with subsequent peritoneal progression\n\t2. Known CDKN2A germline mutation carrier\n\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2024 Diagnostic laparoscopy - peritoneal biopsy\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t1. FOLFIRINOX commenced February 2024\n\t2. Dose reduction to 80% from cycle 3 due to grade 3 neutropenia\n\t3. Currently on cycle 5\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tStable disease on imaging\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy\n\t2. Intermittent abdominal pain\n\t3. Fatigue\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tReviewed today prior to cycle 5 FOLFIRINOX. CT performed last week shows stable disease with no new peritoneal deposits and primary pancreatic mass stable at 4.2cm. Performance status remains 1. Blood results show recovery of neutrophils to 1.8 following previous grade 3 neutropenia. Liver function tests remain within normal range.\n\nPeripheral neuropathy affecting fingers and toes has increased to grade 2, requiring modification of oxaliplatin dose to 60%. Other toxicities include grade 1 fatigue and intermittent abdominal pain well controlled with regular paracetamol. Weight has stabilized at 72kg.\n\nDiscussed ongoing treatment plan with patient who wishes to continue current regime with dose modifications as indicated. Have explained rationale for oxaliplatin dose reduction to manage neuropathy while maintaining disease control.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tRepeat CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after cycle 6\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tOndansetron 8mg bd for 3 days\nDexamethasone 8mg bd for 3 days\nPegfilgrastim 6mg day 4\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up in 2 weeks pre cycle 6\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly FBC monitoring\nUrgent contact if fever or new symptoms",
