  "content": "Diagnosis:\tPancreatic glucagonoma, G2 T3N1 with regional nodal disease\n\nInitial diagnosis March 2024 with elevated glucagon 890 pmol/L. CT-guided biopsy confirmed well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, Ki67 8%, chromogranin and synaptophysin positive.\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today for cycle 3 of capecitabine/temozolomide combination therapy. The initial necrolytic migratory erythema has significantly improved with treatment, and she reports resolution of the previous angular stomatitis. Her weight has stabilized at 64kg following a 12kg loss prior to diagnosis.\n\nLatest CT imaging from 15/4/24 shows stable disease in primary pancreatic tail mass (4.8cm vs 4.9cm) and reduction in size of peripancreatic nodes (largest now 1.2cm vs 1.8cm). Glucagon levels have decreased to 450 pmol/L.\n\nOn examination today, skin appearances are markedly improved with only residual hyperpigmentation on lower limbs. Performance status remains 1. Blood tests show stable liver function, with mild thrombocytopenia (platelets 98) but adequate for continued treatment.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 3 capecitabine/temozolomide at current doses. We will arrange repeat CT and glucagon level prior to cycle 5. Next review in 3 weeks with blood tests?\n",
