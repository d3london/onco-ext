She continues to tolerate treatment reasonably well though experiencing increasing peripheral neuropathy affecting her fingers and toes. This remains grade 2 and she is managing daily activities. Her main symptoms of abdominal bloating and early satiety have improved significantly since starting treatment. Performance status remains 1. Today's blood results show stable renal function and adequate cell counts for treatment. We will proceed with cycle 4 today at full dose but will need to monitor neuropathy closely. Follow-up arranged in 3 weeks for cycle 5, with interim telephone review by specialist nurse. End of treatment CT scan has been booked.",
