  "content": "Many thanks for referring [redacted name] who I reviewed today following his recent diagnosis of lung cancer. He is a 67-year-old gentleman who initially presented in January 2024 with persistent cough and progressive breathlessness. A chest X-ray showed left hilar shadowing, and subsequent CT chest demonstrated a 4.8cm left hilar mass with invasion into the left main bronchus and associated left upper lobe collapse. There was also evidence of ipsilateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy but no distant metastases were identified.\n\nBronchoscopy performed on 15th February 2024 confirmed squamous cell carcinoma, moderately differentiated. PET-CT staging on March 1st showed the primary tumor to be highly FDG-avid with uptake in left hilar and mediastinal nodes, but no evidence of distant disease. MRI brain was negative for metastases. Molecular testing has identified FGFR1 amplification. The overall staging is T3N2M0, Stage IIIB.\n\nIn terms of his background, he has well-controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension. His current medications include metformin, ramipril, and aspirin. He is an ex-smoker having quit 10 years ago with a 40 pack-year history. He maintains good mobility and his performance status is 1.\n\nOn examination today, there are reduced breath sounds in the left upper zone but no added sounds. His oxygen saturations are 95% on air. Recent blood tests show stable renal function and normal liver function tests.\n\nI have discussed his case at our Lung Cancer MDT where the consensus recommendation was for concurrent chemoradiotherapy with curative intent. I have explained this approach in detail today, including the anticipated benefits and potential side effects. He will receive cisplatin and vinorelbine chemotherapy alongside radical radiotherapy (60Gy in 30 fractions). We have arranged for him to commence treatment next week, with chemotherapy starting on April 2nd followed by radiotherapy planning.\n\nHe will be reviewed weekly during treatment in our combined clinic. I have organized baseline blood tests, EDTA clearance, and audiometry prior to starting cisplatin. He has also been referred to our smoking cessation service for ongoing support. We will arrange a CT scan to assess response after completion of treatment.",
