She is clinically well with no concerning symptoms. Thyroid function tests show good biochemical control on Levothyroxine 125mcg daily. Thyroglobulin remains undetectable at <0.1. Neck examination shows well-healed thyroidectomy scar with no palpable abnormalities. Recent ultrasound neck (15.01.24) shows no evidence of recurrence. The plan is to continue current Levothyroxine dose and arrange routine follow-up in 6 months with repeat TFTs and thyroglobulin.",
