Treatment has been well tolerated with only grade 1 fatigue. No immune-related adverse events noted. Surgical site has healed well with good cosmetic outcome. No clinical evidence of local recurrence or new nodal disease. Recent CT chest/abdomen/pelvis (15/4/24) shows no evidence of distant metastases. Blood tests today show stable biochemistry and adequate haematological parameters for treatment continuation. Performance status remains 0.\n\nPlan is to proceed with cycle 4 Avelumab today. Will arrange repeat imaging after cycle 6. Next review in 2 weeks prior to cycle 5.",
