He is now 3 months post-radical cystectomy and recovering well. His weight has stabilized and appetite has returned to normal. He is managing his stoma independently with good support from the specialist nurses. No concerning symptoms reported.\n\nClinical examination today was unremarkable with well-healed surgical scars. Recent blood tests show stable renal function with creatinine 98, normal liver function, and hemoglobin 128.\n\nI have arranged CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for 3 months' time as per surveillance protocol. We will review him following these results. I have advised him to contact us sooner if any new symptoms develop in the interim.",
