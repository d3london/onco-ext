  "content": "I reviewed [redacted name] today who attended with his wife following recent admission to [redacted name] Hospital with worsening abdominal pain and early satiety. As you know, he was diagnosed in January 2024 with a mixed neuroendocrine-ductal carcinoma of the pancreatic body and tail. Initial staging showed a 6.8cm pancreatic mass with multiple bilobar liver metastases. Histology from the liver biopsy confirmed mixed morphology with positive staining for Synaptophysin and CD56, Ki-67 40%.?\n?\nHe initially responded well to combination chemotherapy with Carboplatin and Etoposide, showing partial response after 3 cycles with reduction in liver metastases and improvement in symptoms. Unfortunately, his most recent CT scan on 15th April 2024 shows clear disease progression with increase in size of the pancreatic primary from 5.2cm to 7.1cm and new liver lesions. His chromogranin A has also risen significantly from 280 to 890.?\n?\nHe has experienced significant deterioration in his general condition over the past 3 weeks. His performance status has declined from 1 to 2-3, and he now requires assistance with most daily activities. He describes worsening upper abdominal pain requiring regular breakthrough analgesia, early satiety, and has lost 4kg in weight despite nutritional supplements. He is struggling with persistent nausea, though this is partially controlled with regular ondansetron.?\n?\nOn examination today, he appears notably more cachectic than at his last review. There is tender hepatomegaly extending 4cm below the costal margin. He has peripheral edema to mid-calf bilaterally.?\n?\nI have had a lengthy discussion with [redacted name] and his wife about the changing situation. Given the clear evidence of disease progression and declining performance status, I have explained that continuing with the current chemotherapy regimen would likely cause more harm than benefit. We have agreed to switch to a palliative approach focusing on symptom control.?\n?\nI have made the following changes today:\n1. Increased MST Continus to 60mg BD (previously 30mg BD)\n2. Added Dexamethasone 4mg BD to help with appetite and energy\n3. Started regular Creon with meals\n4. Arranged urgent referral to the palliative care team?\n?\nI have also organized weekly community nurse reviews and arranged to see him again in 2 weeks' time, sooner if needed. The palliative care team will contact them within 48 hours to review his symptom control needs at home.",
