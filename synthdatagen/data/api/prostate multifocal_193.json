  "content": "I was pleased to review [redacted name] today in the Uro-oncology Clinical Trials Unit. He was diagnosed with locally advanced prostate cancer in January 2024, with initial PSA of 28.9. Histology from systematic biopsies confirmed multifocal ductal adenocarcinoma, ISUP Grade Group 4 (Gleason 4+4=8), with evidence of extraprostatic extension and early seminal vesicle involvement on MRI (T3b disease). Staging investigations including CT chest/abdomen/pelvis and bone scan have shown no evidence of metastatic disease. Germline testing has identified a pathogenic BRCA1 mutation.\n\nHe has completed 3 months of androgen deprivation therapy with good biochemical response, PSA now 0.8. He remains very active with excellent performance status (ECOG PS 0) and continues his work as a university professor. His main symptoms are mild hot flushes from the hormonal therapy but otherwise he is managing well.\n\nFollowing extensive discussion at our molecular tumour board and subsequent conversations with [redacted name], I am pleased to confirm his eligibility for the PROpel-RT trial. This phase III study is investigating the addition of olaparib to standard radiotherapy and androgen deprivation in BRCA-mutated locally advanced prostate cancer. Today we completed trial screening assessments including baseline blood tests, ECG, and quality of life questionnaires. I have provided comprehensive written information about the trial protocol, potential risks and benefits, and requirements for additional hospital visits and monitoring.\n\nHe demonstrates excellent understanding of the trial and has signed the informed consent today. His baseline blood results show adequate renal function (eGFR 85) and liver function, with haemoglobin 138 g/L. Random glucose was 5.2 mmol/L. Trial-mandated cardiac assessment shows normal ECG with QTc 420ms.\n\nThe plan is to commence trial treatment in 2 weeks following completion of all screening investigations. He will receive standard radiotherapy (74Gy in 37 fractions) with randomisation to either olaparib 300mg BD or matching placebo. Androgen deprivation will continue for a total of 3 years as per standard care. We will see him weekly during radiotherapy treatment with formal trial assessments every 12 weeks. I have arranged baseline CT planning scan for next week and provided emergency contact details for the trial team.\n?\n",
