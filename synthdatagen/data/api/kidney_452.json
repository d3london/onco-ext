He has made an excellent recovery from surgery with good wound healing. His post-operative pain has largely resolved and he has returned to most normal activities. His appetite has improved and he reports gaining 2kg since discharge. Blood pressure is well controlled at 132/78mmHg. Blood tests show stable renal function with creatinine 98 umol/L. Chest x-ray shows no evidence of metastatic disease.\n\nThe plan is for surveillance with 3-monthly CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for the first year. I have arranged the first scan for June 2024 and will review him afterwards with the results. He has my contact details should any concerns arise in the interim.",
