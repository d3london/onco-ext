She has made an excellent recovery from surgery with no ongoing complications. Her weight has stabilized at 62kg and she is managing a suitable post-gastrectomy diet with appropriate supplements. She reports good energy levels and has returned to work part-time. Blood tests show satisfactory vitamin B12 and iron levels. No concerning symptoms or examination findings. The complete pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is very encouraging. We have discussed the standard follow-up schedule. She will have 3-monthly clinic reviews for the first year with surveillance CT at 6 months. I have provided written information about post-gastrectomy care and symptoms that should prompt earlier review.",
