  "content": "Diagnosis:\nLocally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, stage T4aN1M0 (AJCC 8th edition, Stage IVA)\n\nCurrent situation:\nPost cycle 3 cisplatin/5FU chemotherapy\n\nMDT Discussion:\nCase presented at Upper GI MDT on 15 April 2024\n\nImaging:\nCT 10 April 2024 shows stable disease with primary tumor measuring 5.8cm (previously 6.0cm) with stable regional nodal disease. No distant metastases.\n\nClinical Update:\nPerformance status remains 1. Managing to maintain oral intake with pureed diet. Weight stable at 68kg.\n\nMDT Recommendation:\nEvidence of disease stability on current chemotherapy regimen. Plan to complete planned 6 cycles of cisplatin/5FU, then proceed to radical chemoradiotherapy if disease remains controlled.\n\nPlan:\n1. Continue with cycles 4-6 cisplatin/5FU\n2. Repeat CT after cycle 6\n3. Review in combined clinic with clinical oncology after completion of chemotherapy\n4. Continue weekly dietetic support\n\nNext appointment:\nPre-cycle 4 assessment in 2 weeks",
