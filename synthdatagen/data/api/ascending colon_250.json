  "content": "Diagnosis:\nT4bN2M1 ascending colon adenocarcinoma with signet ring features and peritoneal metastases\nDiagnosed 12/2023 via colonoscopy and staging CT\nHER2 amplified, PIK3CA mutant\n\nPrevious Treatment:\nJan 2024 - Right hemicolectomy\nFeb-Apr 2024 - 4 cycles FOLFOX/Trastuzumab\n\nCurrent Status:\nPartial response after 4 cycles\nCT 15.4.24 shows 40% reduction in peritoneal disease volume\nCA19-9 decreased from 450 to 180\n\nTreatment Update:\nCycle 4 complicated by Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy\nOxaliplatin discontinued\n\nPlan:\nCommence modified regimen:\n- 5-FU/leucovorin/trastuzumab to continue\n- Addition of alpelisib 300mg daily for PIK3CA mutation\n- Weekly review for first month\n\nNext Review:\nChemotherapy unit next week for cycle 5\nRepeat CT after cycle 6\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today in the GI oncology clinic. Despite good radiological response, oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy has progressed significantly, affecting daily activities. After discussion of options, we will discontinue oxaliplatin while maintaining 5-FU/leucovorin/trastuzumab backbone. Given the PIK3CA mutation, we will add alpelisib. The rationale and side effects of alpelisib have been discussed, including hyperglycemia risk. Blood glucose monitoring arranged. Patient understands to contact us if new symptoms develop.",
