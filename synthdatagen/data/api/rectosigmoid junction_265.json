  "content": "Diagnosis:\tAdenocarcinoma of rectosigmoid junction, T3N0M0\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today for assessment during adjuvant chemotherapy. He is currently receiving cycle 4 of CAPOX following anterior resection on 15 January 2024. Histology confirmed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with clear margins, MSS and BRAF wild-type status.\n\nHe is tolerating treatment relatively well with PS 0-1. Main side effects include grade 1 peripheral neuropathy affecting fingertips only, and occasional loose stools well managed with loperamide. Blood tests today show stable parameters with no dose-limiting toxicity.\n\nOn examination, his surgical wound has healed well. Abdomen is soft and non-tender with normal bowel sounds. No concerning clinical findings.\n\nWe will proceed with cycle 4 CAPOX today at full dose. Two further cycles are planned to complete the adjuvant course.",
