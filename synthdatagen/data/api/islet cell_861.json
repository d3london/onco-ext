Treatment has been well tolerated with only mild injection site reactions. His gastric symptoms are well controlled on current PPI dose. Weight is stable at 72kg. Performance status remains 0. Blood tests show continued biochemical response with gastrin now 180 pg/mL. Recent CT imaging confirms stable appearances with no evidence of recurrent disease. The plan is to continue with monthly Lanreotide injections and review again in 3 months with repeat imaging and biochemical markers.",
