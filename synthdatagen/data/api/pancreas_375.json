  "content": "Diagnosis:\t\tPancreatic neuroendocrine tumor\n\nManagement:\t\t12 Apr 2024 Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy\n\nHistology:\t\tWell-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, Grade 1 (Ki67 2%), 2.8cm diameter, R0 resection margins, no lymphovascular invasion. pT2N0M0.\n\nBiomarkers:\t\tChromogranin A and B positive. Synaptophysin positive.\n\nCurrent situation:\tPost-operative review\n\n[redacted name] has made an excellent recovery following surgery. Her post-operative course was uncomplicated and she was discharged on day 5. Her surgical wounds have healed well and she reports good energy levels, with normal appetite and stable weight. She has experienced some early satiety but this is improving. Blood glucose monitoring shows good control.\n\nToday's blood tests show normal Chromogranin A level at 65 ng/L. Liver and renal function are within normal range. Her post-splenectomy vaccinations have been completed as per protocol.\n\nI have discussed surveillance plans with [redacted name]. We will arrange 6-monthly CT imaging for the first two years, alongside regular Chromogranin A measurements. First surveillance scan booked for October 2024. She will be reviewed in clinic with these results.",
