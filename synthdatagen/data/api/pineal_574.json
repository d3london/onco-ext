The latest MRI brain (15/5/24) shows stable appearances of the residual pineal mass measuring 1.2 x 0.8cm, unchanged from previous imaging. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus. Her neurological examination remains normal with no new deficits. She reports good energy levels and has returned to work full-time. The mild headaches she experienced during radiotherapy have completely resolved. She will continue on our standard surveillance protocol with next MRI brain in 4 months and clinic review thereafter.",
