  "content": "I reviewed [redacted name] today in the FGFR3-targeted therapy trial clinic. She was diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer in January 2024, initially presenting with haematuria. Initial staging showed a 4.8cm posterior wall mass with right-sided pelvic lymphadenopathy. Histology confirmed lipid-rich variant urothelial carcinoma, and molecular profiling identified an FGFR3 S249C mutation making her eligible for the phase II BEACON-B trial.\n\nShe commenced erdafitinib 8mg daily on 15th March 2024 following completion of trial screening. The first 4 weeks of treatment were complicated by grade 2 hyperphosphatemia requiring phosphate binder therapy, and grade 2 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia necessitating a 5-day treatment break. Following restart at 6mg daily, she has maintained stable disease on her week 8 CT scan with a 15% reduction in the primary bladder mass and stable pelvic nodes.\n\nHowever, at today's week 12 assessment, she reports worsening lower back pain and new onset right-sided sciatica. Her performance status has deteriorated from ECOG 1 to 2, though she remains independent with activities of daily living. She lives with her husband who provides good support. Examination reveals new tenderness over the right sacroiliac joint. Recent blood tests show stable renal function but rising alkaline phosphatase from 156 to 289.\n\nGiven these concerning symptoms, I have arranged an urgent MRI spine and pelvis to exclude disease progression, particularly given the rising ALP. If progression is confirmed, she will discontinue trial treatment as per protocol and be considered for standard platinum-based chemotherapy. I have prescribed additional analgesia with oral morphine solution and arranged review with our trial physiotherapist. She will return to clinic in one week with the MRI results. The trial team has been notified of these developments and our acute oncology service is aware should she require urgent review.\n\nIn the interim, she will continue erdafitinib 6mg daily with close monitoring of phosphate levels and skin toxicity. She understands to contact us immediately if symptoms worsen, particularly if she develops any new neurological symptoms. A further CT scan will be arranged if the MRI confirms progression.",
