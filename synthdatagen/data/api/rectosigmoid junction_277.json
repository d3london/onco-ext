  "content": "Diagnosis:\nMetastatic rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma with peritoneal and liver metastases\n\nPrevious treatment:\nJanuary 2024 - Palliative right hemicolectomy and ileostomy formation\nFebruary-April 2024 - 4 cycles FOLFOX chemotherapy\nMay 2024 - Changed to FOLFIRI due to disease progression\n\nHistology:\nPoorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, MMR proficient, BRAF wild-type\n\nCurrent medications:\nOndansetron 8mg PRN\nDexamethasone 4mg BD\nOxycodone MR 30mg BD\nOxycodone IR 5mg PRN\n\nCurrent situation:\nProgressive disease after cycle 2 FOLFIRI\n\nCT 15 June 2024 shows:\n- New peritoneal deposits\n- Increase in liver metastases with largest lesion now 8.2cm (previously 6.5cm)\n- New moderate volume ascites\n\nCEA rising from 245 to 890\n\nPerformance status deteriorated to ECOG 3\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who has unfortunately experienced significant clinical deterioration over the past 3 weeks. His performance status has declined markedly and he is now spending most of the day in bed or chair. His appetite is poor with early satiety due to ascites. He reports increased abdominal pain requiring escalation of opioid analgesia. Weight has dropped by 4kg since last review.\n\nOn examination, he appears cachectic with marked peripheral edema. Abdomen is distended with shifting dullness confirming ascites. Tender hepatomegaly extending 6cm below costal margin.\n\nGiven his marked deterioration and radiological progression, we have discussed discontinuing systemic therapy. He understands and accepts this decision. I have made an urgent referral to the palliative care team and arranged community support. He will be reviewed by them next week. We have prescribed additional medications for symptom control including spironolactone for ascites.\n\nPlan:\n1. Stop FOLFIRI chemotherapy\n2. Urgent palliative care review arranged for next week\n3. District nurse referral completed\n4. Telephone review by oncology CNS in 1 week\n5. Open access to acute oncology if needed",
