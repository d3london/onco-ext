Progressive disease with new pulmonary metastases\n\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2024 Composite resection with free flap reconstruction\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\t1 Mar - 15 Apr 2024 Adjuvant IMRT 66Gy in 33 fractions to primary site and bilateral neck\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tNot indicated\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease with new pulmonary metastases\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tBreathlessness on exertion\nPersistent oral pain\nDysphagia requiring soft diet\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 56-year-old gentleman has unfortunately developed progressive disease. Recent CT chest performed on 15 May 2024 shows multiple new bilateral pulmonary nodules, largest measuring 2.1cm in right lower lobe. NGS testing has identified an NTRK fusion, making him eligible for targeted therapy.\n\nHe reports increasing breathlessness on exertion over the past month, though maintains PS 1. Oral pain persists requiring regular opioid analgesia. Weight has dropped by 3kg since last review.\n\nOn examination, oral cavity shows expected post-surgical changes with no obvious local recurrence. Chest examination reveals scattered crackles bilaterally.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tMRI head with contrast - to exclude intracranial metastases\nPET-CT - for full staging update\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tLarotrectinib 100mg BD to start pending funding approval\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up in 2 weeks with scan results\nUrgent referral to palliative care team made\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPlease monitor renal function and LFTs weekly during first month of targeted therapy\n\n\tSummary of information given to patient\n\tDiscussed progressive disease and treatment options including clinical trials. Patient understands palliative intent of further treatment.",
