Her prolactin has normalized from initial level of 2500 mIU/L to 280 mIU/L on cabergoline 0.5mg twice weekly. She reports good medication compliance despite occasional mild nausea. Visual fields remain normal. Recent pituitary MRI (15/03/2024) shows reduction in adenoma size from 6mm to 3mm. Regular menstrual cycles have resumed. The plan is to continue current cabergoline dose with biochemical monitoring in 3 months and repeat MRI in 6 months. She will be reviewed in clinic following the next MRI scan.",
