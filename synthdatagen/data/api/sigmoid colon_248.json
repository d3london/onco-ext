  "content": "Diagnosis:\tpT3N1M0 sigmoid adenocarcinoma\n\nManagement:\tAnterior resection March 2023\n\t\tCompleted adjuvant CAPOX chemotherapy October 2023\n\nHistology:\tModerately differentiated adenocarcinoma, MMR proficient, KRAS mutant, BRAF wild-type\n\nCurrent Situation:\tRoutine surveillance review\n\n[redacted name] attended for routine follow-up today. She has completed 6 months of adjuvant CAPOX chemotherapy in October 2023 and is now under surveillance. She reports feeling well with good energy levels and has returned to work full-time. Her bowel function has normalized with 2-3 formed motions daily. She has regained the weight lost during chemotherapy and is now back to her baseline of 65kg. The mild peripheral neuropathy she experienced during treatment has largely resolved, though she still notices occasional tingling in her fingertips.\n\nCT scan performed last week shows no evidence of disease recurrence. Blood tests including CEA are within normal range. Clinical examination today was unremarkable.\n\nThe plan is to continue with standard follow-up protocol. I have arranged her next CT scan for 6 months' time and will see her in clinic following this. She understands to contact us sooner if she develops any new concerning symptoms.",
