  "content": "Diagnosis:\tT3N0M0 hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, p16 negative\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of radical chemoradiotherapy in March 2024. He completed 6 weeks of radiotherapy with concurrent weekly cisplatin, managing 5 out of planned 6 cycles. The final cycle was omitted due to grade 2 mucositis.\n\nHe reports good improvement in swallowing function over the past 6 weeks, now managing a soft diet without significant pain. His weight has stabilized at 72kg. Ongoing mild xerostomia is managed with regular sips of water. Voice quality has improved though some residual hoarseness persists. No dyspnoea or stridor. Performance status remains 1.\n\nClinical examination shows expected post-treatment changes in the hypopharyngeal mucosa but no suspicious lesions. No palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. Flexible nasendoscopy demonstrates good healing of the primary site with no evidence of residual or recurrent disease.\n\nPost-treatment PET-CT from last week shows complete metabolic response with no evidence of active disease. Blood tests, including renal function, are satisfactory.\n\nThe plan is to continue regular follow-up. I will see him again in 8 weeks with repeat blood tests. CT neck/chest planned for 3 months' time as per protocol. He understands to contact us sooner if new symptoms develop.",
