Metastatic malignant insulinoma of pancreatic islet cell origin\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative - disease control and symptom management\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2024 Diagnostic laparoscopic biopsy of pancreatic mass and liver metastasis\n\n\tSystemic therapy\n\t1. Commenced Lanreotide 120mg monthly from 01 Feb 2024\n\t2. Diazoxide 150mg TDS for hypoglycemia management\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tStable disease on imaging with improving biochemical markers\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Hypoglycemic episodes - frequency reducing\n\t2. Right upper quadrant pain - controlled\n\t3. T12 vertebral metastasis - asymptomatic\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 58-year-old gentleman was diagnosed following episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia. Initial insulin level was 180 mIU/L with elevated proinsulin. CT demonstrated a 3.2cm pancreatic tail mass with bilobar liver metastases and a solitary T12 vertebral metastasis. Biopsy confirmed well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (Ki-67 8%).\n\nHe has responded well to initiation of Lanreotide with reduction in hypoglycemic episodes from 4-5 daily to 1-2 weekly. Latest fasting glucose is 4.2 mmol/L. CT at 8 weeks shows stable disease in pancreatic primary and liver metastases. Chromogranin A has decreased from 280 to 180 ng/mL.\n\nHe maintains good performance status and has returned to part-time work. Right upper quadrant pain is well controlled on regular paracetamol.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\t1. Ga-68 DOTATATE PET-CT - booked for 15 Apr 2024\n\t2. Fasting gut hormone profile in 4 weeks\n\t3. MRI liver in 3 months\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\t1. Continue Lanreotide 120mg monthly\n\t2. Continue Diazoxide 150mg TDS\n\t3. Paracetamol 1g QDS PRN\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up in 4 weeks with blood results\n\tMDT discussion planned following DOTATATE scan\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly fasting glucose monitoring\n\tUrgent contact if hypoglycemic episodes increase",
