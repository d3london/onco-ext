Her main side effect has been a mild rash which is adequately controlled with regular moisturizer. Fatigue has improved since starting treatment. Blood tests show stable renal and liver function. Given the good radiological response and tolerability, we will continue with the current dose of Trametinib. Follow up arranged in 4 weeks with repeat CA125.",
