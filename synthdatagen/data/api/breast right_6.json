  "content": "Diagnosis:\tTriple negative right breast cancer with bone metastases\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today prior to cycle 4 of TCHP chemotherapy. Her initial diagnosis in January 2024 showed a 3.5cm grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma with axillary nodal involvement and bone metastases. Biomarker status confirmed triple negative disease with high Ki67 of 80%.\n\nShe has responded well to treatment with reducing breast mass on clinical examination and improving pain from her thoracic spine metastasis following palliative radiotherapy completed in February 2024. The breast mass has reduced from 3.5cm to 1.8cm on ultrasound performed last week. Her previous CT scan in March 2024 showed partial response in bone metastases.\n\nShe has experienced grade 2 peripheral neuropathy affecting her fingers and toes, but this has stabilized with the 20% dose reduction of paclitaxel implemented from cycle 3. Her cardiac function remains stable on the latest echo with LVEF 55%. Blood tests today show adequate parameters to proceed with cycle 4.\n\nThe plan is to continue with cycle 4 TCHP today at current doses. We will arrange a progress CT scan before cycle 6. She will be reviewed again in 3 weeks prior to cycle 5.",
