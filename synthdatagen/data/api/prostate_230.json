Metastatic prostate cancer with rhabdoid differentiation\n\t   Diagnosed January 2024\n\t   Stage IV disease with brain metastases and spinal cord compression\n\t   Treatment aim: Palliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2024 Emergency T8-T10 decompressive laminectomy\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\t20 Jan 2024 Emergency whole brain radiotherapy 20Gy in 5 fractions\n\t25 Jan 2024 Post-operative thoracic spine radiotherapy 30Gy in 10 fractions\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t1 Feb 2024 Commenced Docetaxel and ADT\n\t15 Mar 2024 Docetaxel discontinued after 3 cycles due to clinical deterioration\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNot suitable\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tClinically progressive disease with deteriorating neurological function\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Progressive neurological deficit\n\t2. Severe fatigue\n\t3. Cognitive decline\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tI reviewed [redacted name] today who attended with his wife and daughter. Unfortunately, he has experienced significant clinical deterioration over the past two weeks. His mobility has worsened with increasing lower limb weakness, now requiring wheelchair for all transfers. He is spending >50% of time in bed (PS 3). New onset confusion and memory problems suggest progression of brain metastases despite previous WBRT.\n\nHis PSA has risen from 567 to 890 despite ADT. Recent molecular profiling shows RB1 and TP53 loss, suggesting evolution to treatment-resistant disease. MRI spine shows new epidural disease at C5-C6 despite previous radiotherapy to thoracic spine.\n\nOn examination, there is marked reduction in power of both lower limbs (3/5 proximally, 2/5 distally), with new left-sided upper limb weakness (4/5). Cognitive assessment shows significant deterioration with MMSE 18/30 (previously 26/30).\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tUrgent MRI brain arranged for tomorrow\n\tRepeat CT CAP booked for next week if clinically appropriate\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tDexamethasone increased to 8mg BD\n\tIncreased opioid analgesia\n\n\tFollow up\n\tUrgent palliative care review arranged for tomorrow\n\tNeurosurgical opinion requested regarding C5-C6 compression\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPlease arrange urgent community palliative care support\n\tConsider DS1500\n\n\tSummary of information given to patient and family\n\tDetailed discussion with family regarding disease progression and poor prognosis. Agreement to focus on symptom control and quality of life. DNR status confirmed.",
