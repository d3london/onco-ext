  "content": "Diagnosis\n\t1. Hurthle cell thyroid carcinoma T4aN1M1\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Jan 2024 Total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\t1 Mar 2024 - 15 Mar 2024 Palliative radiotherapy to T7 vertebral metastasis\n\n\tSystemic therapy\n\t1. Lenvatinib 24mg daily commenced 1 Feb 2024\n\t2. Dose reduction to 14mg daily on 1 Mar 2024 due to grade 3 hypertension\n\t3. Further dose reduction to 10mg daily on 15 Apr 2024 due to persistent fatigue\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNot eligible\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease with new liver metastases\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Worsening bone pain\n\t2. Grade 2 fatigue\n\t3. Controlled hypertension on treatment\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who attended with her husband. Unfortunately, recent imaging shows disease progression with new liver metastases despite Lenvatinib therapy. The CT scan from 20 Apr 2024 demonstrates three new liver lesions measuring up to 2.8cm, while the known bone metastases show mixed response with some lesions stable and others showing progression. Thyroglobulin has increased from 2500 to 4200 over the past month.\n\nShe reports worsening bone pain, particularly in her thoracic spine and right hip, requiring increased analgesia. Her blood pressure is now well-controlled on amlodipine 10mg daily, but she continues to experience significant fatigue limiting her daily activities. Performance status has declined to ECOG 2.\n\nOn examination, there is tenderness over T7 vertebra and right hip. Liver span is increased to 16cm with a palpable edge but no tenderness. No focal neurological deficits identified.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\t1. MRI spine to assess for cord compression\n\t2. Bone scan to reassess extent of skeletal disease\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\t1. Increased MST to 60mg BD from 30mg BD\n\t2. Added Pregabalin 75mg BD for neuropathic pain\n\n\tFollow up\n\tUrgent review in 2 weeks with scan results\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\t1. Weekly blood pressure monitoring\n\t2. Monitor renal function\n\t3. Titrate analgesia as needed following pain team review",
