She has tolerated the treatment well with only grade 1 skin reaction which is now resolving. There is mild breast tenderness but no concerning symptoms. Her energy levels are improving and she has returned to work part-time.\n\nOn examination, there is expected post-radiation change in the left breast with mild erythema and no concerning features. The surgical scar is well-healed. No lymphadenopathy.\n\nI have discussed the treatment completion and ongoing hormone therapy plan. She will start tamoxifen 20mg daily from next week. I have provided written information about side effects and encouraged her to contact the breast care nurses if needed.\n\nThe plan is for annual mammogram surveillance and clinical review in 6 months. She understands to report any new concerning symptoms.",
