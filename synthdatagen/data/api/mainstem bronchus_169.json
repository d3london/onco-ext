  "content": "Diagnosis:\nLocally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of right mainstem bronchus, T4N1M0\n\nPrevious treatment:\nCompleted concurrent chemoradiotherapy March 2024 (cisplatin/etoposide with 60Gy in 30 fractions)\n\nCurrent medications:\nDexamethasone 4mg bd\nCo-codamol 30/500mg qds prn\nOndansetron 8mg bd prn\n\nAllergies:\nNone known\n\nCurrent situation:\nDisease progression confirmed on CT 15 May 2024\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who has unfortunately shown radiological progression of disease following completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The CT scan from 15/5/24 shows enlargement of the right hilar mass from 4.2cm to 6.1cm with new right paratracheal lymphadenopathy and increasing right upper lobe collapse. His main symptoms are worsening dyspnoea on minimal exertion and persistent cough productive of white sputum. His performance status has declined to ECOG 2, and he has lost 4kg in weight over the past month despite nutritional supplements.\n\nOn examination today, there is reduced air entry throughout the right lung field with coarse crackles in the upper zone. Oxygen saturations are 92% on room air at rest. No peripheral oedema or clubbing.\n\nGiven the confirmed progression and current performance status, I have had a detailed discussion with [redacted name] regarding second-line treatment options. His tumor shows PD-L1 expression of 30% and CDKN2A loss on molecular testing. We have agreed to commence single-agent pembrolizumab 200mg every 3 weeks. I have explained the mechanism of action, potential side effects including immune-related toxicities, and expected response rates. He understands to contact us urgently if he develops any new symptoms.\n\nPlan:\n1. Commence pembrolizumab 200mg every 3 weeks\n2. Continue current supportive medications\n3. Urgent referral to palliative care team for symptom management\n4. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after 3 cycles to assess response\n5. Review in 3 weeks pre-cycle 2",
