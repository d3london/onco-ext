  "content": "Diagnosis:\nStage IV ALK-positive adenocarcinoma of left upper lobe with malignant pleural effusion\n\nPrevious treatment:\nCrizotinib 250mg BD commenced January 2024\nThoracentesis x2 for symptomatic relief\n\nCurrent medications:\nCrizotinib 250mg BD\nDexamethasone 4mg BD\nAprepitant PRN\nOndansetron PRN\n\nCurrent situation:\nProgressive disease on crizotinib after initial response\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who has unfortunately shown evidence of disease progression on current treatment. Initial partial response was seen on CT chest performed 6 weeks after starting crizotinib with reduction in primary mass from 4.2cm to 2.8cm and improvement in pleural effusion. However, recent CT on 15 April 2024 shows enlargement of primary mass to 5.1cm with new satellite nodules and re-accumulation of left pleural effusion causing increasing breathlessness.\n\nShe reports worsening dyspnoea on minimal exertion (ECOG PS 3) and requires oxygen 2L/min at rest. She has also developed new onset hoarseness and left-sided chest pain requiring regular opioid analgesia. Weight has dropped by 4kg since last review.\n\nOn examination, there is dullness to percussion and reduced air entry throughout left hemithorax. Oxygen saturations 92% on 2L/min oxygen. No evidence of SVC obstruction or neurological signs.\n\nI have discussed these findings with [redacted name] and her daughter. Given clear evidence of disease progression, I recommend switching to second-line ALK inhibitor therapy with brigatinib. I have explained the rationale, administration schedule and potential side effects. She understands the need for careful monitoring of early pulmonary symptoms.\n\nPlan:\n1. Discontinue crizotinib\n2. Start brigatinib at 90mg OD for 7 days then increase to 180mg OD if tolerated\n3. Arrange urgent pleural aspiration with consideration of pleurodesis\n4. Refer to palliative care team for symptom management support\n5. Review in 2 weeks with CXR and early toxicity assessment\n6. Repeat CT chest in 6 weeks to assess response",
