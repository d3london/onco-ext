She has shown remarkable resilience through her treatment journey. The initial dose-dense EC was well tolerated with only grade 1 nausea and minimal fatigue. Since starting paclitaxel with capivasertib, she has experienced intermittent diarrhea, currently grade 2, managed with loperamide as per trial protocol. Her fatigue remains grade 1 and she continues her daily walks, though at a reduced pace.\n\nHer blood tests today show stable parameters with neutrophils 2.1, platelets 156, and normal liver function. Trial-mandated cardiac monitoring with recent echocardiogram shows preserved ejection fraction at 58%. Quality of life assessments completed today show slight improvement in fatigue scores compared to cycle 3.\n\nShe is coping well psychologically and feels supported by our research team. Her husband attended today and they both expressed appreciation for the regular monitoring and support provided through the trial.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tTrial-mandated CT chest/abdomen/pelvis scheduled for after cycle 6\n\tNext echocardiogram due prior to cycle 6\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tCapivasertib 400mg BD, days 1-4 of each weekly paclitaxel\n\tLoperamide 2mg prn for diarrhea\n\n\tFollow up\n\tWeekly review during paclitaxel/capivasertib treatment\nNext trial assessment visit scheduled for 15/5/24\n\n\tRequired trial protocol actions\n\tQuality of life questionnaire completed\nAdverse event log updated\nTrial medication diary reviewed and collected\nNext cycle drug dispensing arranged",
