He is managing the treatment relatively well with grade 1 radiation dermatitis affecting the right scalp and neck treatment fields. He reports some mild fatigue but is maintaining normal daily activities. His appetite remains good with stable weight. The surgical sites are well healed with no evidence of recurrence. The skin graft shows good take with no complications. Performance status remains 0.\n\nOn examination, there is expected radiation-related erythema of the scalp and right neck. No palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. The treated area shows no evidence of recurrence.\n\nThe plan is to complete the prescribed course of radiotherapy (60Gy in 30 fractions). We will review again in clinic in 2 weeks' time at treatment completion.",
