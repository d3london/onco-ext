  "content": "Diagnosis:\tClear cell renal cell carcinoma, initially T3aN1M0\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of cycle 3 of combination immunotherapy with Ipilimumab/Nivolumab. He was diagnosed in January 2024 following investigation of right flank pain, with imaging showing a 9.2cm right renal mass with hilar nodal involvement. He underwent cytoreductive right radical nephrectomy on 15 February 2024, with histology confirming clear cell renal cell carcinoma, grade 3, with renal sinus invasion and 2/8 positive hilar nodes. Immunohistochemistry showed high CAIX expression.\n\nHe commenced combination immunotherapy on 15 March 2024 and has now completed three cycles. I am pleased to report an excellent clinical response. His post-operative pain has completely resolved and his energy levels have significantly improved. His most recent CT scan on 1 May 2024 shows no evidence of residual or recurrent disease, with previously noted hilar nodes now within normal limits.\n\nHe has experienced some immune-related adverse events, notably grade 2 colitis after cycle 2 requiring oral prednisolone 40mg daily, which has now successfully been weaned to 10mg daily. His thyroid function remains normal on monitoring. Recent blood tests show stable renal function with creatinine 125 μmol/L, normal liver function, and mild anaemia with Hb 115 g/L which is improving post-operatively.\n\nOn examination today, his surgical wounds are well healed, and he has no concerning clinical findings. His performance status is 0 and he has returned to work full-time as an accountant. He continues to exercise regularly with swimming and gentle gym work.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 4 of combination immunotherapy today, followed by transition to Nivolumab maintenance as per protocol. I have explained the importance of ongoing immune-related toxicity monitoring. We will arrange a progress CT scan after cycle 4 and review him again in clinic in 3 weeks with the results. His case will be re-discussed at our Renal MDT next week.",
