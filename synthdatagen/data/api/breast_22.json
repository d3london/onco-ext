She completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 6 cycles of docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab/pertuzumab in January 2024, achieving partial response. She underwent left wide local excision with axillary clearance on 15 February 2024, showing residual invasive disease of 2.8cm with 2/12 positive nodes, making her eligible for the KATHERINE trial. She was randomized on 15 March 2024 and today completes cycle 4 of trial medication.\n\nShe is tolerating the trial medication well with only grade 1 fatigue and occasional headaches. Her main side effect is mild peripheral neuropathy affecting her fingertips, which she rates as 2/10 severity and is not impacting daily activities. Blood tests show stable parameters with hemoglobin 118 g/L, platelets 245, normal liver function. Cardiac monitoring shows preserved ejection fraction at 58% on latest echo (12 April 2024).\n\nOn examination today, her left breast surgical site is well-healed with no concerning features. There is no lymphedema. Performance status remains 0.\n\nI have completed the trial-specific quality of life questionnaires and toxicity assessments. She will continue with cycle 5 today as per protocol. Next trial assessment is scheduled in 3 weeks with repeat cardiac imaging as per protocol timeline.",
