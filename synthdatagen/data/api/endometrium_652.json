Performance status remains 0.\n\nBlood results show stable parameters with haemoglobin 115 g/L, neutrophils 2.8, platelets 178. Renal and liver function remain normal.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 4 chemotherapy today. We will see her again before cycle 5 in three weeks time. CT scan will be arranged after completion of treatment to confirm no evidence of disease.",
