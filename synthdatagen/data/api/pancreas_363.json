Beta-catenin nuclear positive. Ki67 2%.\n\nCurrent situation:\tFirst post-operative oncology review\n\n[redacted name] attended clinic today following recent surgery. She has made an excellent recovery from her operation with minimal post-operative complications. Her surgical wounds have healed well and she reports good appetite. She is managing a normal diet without symptoms of malabsorption. Her weight is stable at 64kg.\n\nOn examination, her surgical wounds are well-healed. Abdomen is soft and non-tender with no palpable masses. Performance status is 0.\n\nGiven the complete resection and favourable histological features, no adjuvant treatment is required. We will arrange surveillance CT scan at 6 months and see her back in clinic with the results. She has been advised to contact us if she develops any new symptoms in the meantime.",
