She remains well with no concerning symptoms. Her TSH is well-suppressed at 0.1 and thyroglobulin remains undetectable (<0.1). Neck examination shows well-healed thyroidectomy scar with no palpable abnormalities. Recent ultrasound neck (15/4/24) shows no evidence of recurrence. Tolerating levothyroxine 150mcg daily with no side effects. Plan to continue current management with next review in 6 months with thyroglobulin measurement and TSH check. Will arrange repeat ultrasound neck for 12 months' time.",
