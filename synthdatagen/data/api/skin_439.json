Initial excision biopsy on 28/3/24 confirmed a malignant melanoma with Breslow thickness 2.8mm, Clark level IV, no ulceration, and no lymphovascular invasion. She proceeded to wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy on 15/4/24. Final histology confirmed complete excision with 2cm margins. Two sentinel nodes were negative for metastatic disease. Molecular testing has identified an NRAS Q61R mutation.\n?\nIn her past medical history, she has mild asthma controlled with salbutamol inhaler. She takes no regular medications and has no known drug allergies. She works as an accountant and lives with her husband and two teenage children. She has never smoked.\n?\nOn examination today, the surgical site is well-healed with no evidence of local recurrence or in-transit disease. There is no palpable lymphadenopathy. Her performance status is 0.\n?\nI have discussed the diagnosis and prognosis with [redacted name]. Given the stage T2bN0M0 disease, we have arranged baseline CT chest/abdomen/pelvis and MRI brain for staging. She will be followed up in the melanoma surveillance clinic every 3 months for the first year, with regular imaging as per protocol. I have provided written information about sun protection and skin self-examination. She will be reviewed with the scan results in 2 weeks.",
