  "content": "Diagnosis:\nPapillary thyroid carcinoma, T1aN0M0\n\nSurgery:\n15 January 2024 - Total thyroidectomy\n\nHistology:\nWell-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma, 0.8cm, no extrathyroidal extension, margins clear. NTRK fusion negative.\n\nTreatment:\nRadioactive iodine ablation 1.1GBq completed 12 March 2024\n\nCurrent situation:\nPost-treatment whole body scan shows no evidence of residual disease or metastases\n\nThyroid function:\nTSH 0.02 (suppressed as planned)\nfT4 22.4 (within target range)\n\nCurrent medications:\nLevothyroxine 175mcg daily\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of radioactive iodine ablation treatment. She has recovered well with no significant side effects from the treatment. Mild dry mouth has now completely resolved. She reports good energy levels and has returned to work full time. Examination shows well-healed thyroidectomy scar with no concerning features in the neck.\n\nThe post-ablation whole body scan shows no evidence of residual disease or metastatic uptake. Thyroglobulin is undetectable (<0.1) with negative thyroglobulin antibodies, indicating excellent response to treatment.\n\nThe plan is to continue current dose of levothyroxine maintaining TSH suppression. She will have thyroid function tests with GP in 6 weeks. Follow up appointment arranged for 6 months with thyroglobulin measurement.",
