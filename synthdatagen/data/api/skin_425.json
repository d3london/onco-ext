The first cycle was well tolerated with only grade 1 fatigue lasting 48 hours. No immune-related adverse events have occurred. The surgical site continues to heal well with no concerning features. Blood tests today show normal thyroid function, renal function and liver function. Performance status remains 0. We will proceed with cycle 2 today and arrange routine imaging prior to cycle 4. Next review in 3 weeks with blood tests.",
