  "content": "Diagnosis:\tProstate adenocarcinoma\n\nManagement:\tRadical radiotherapy planned\n\nHistology:\tGleason 3+4=7 (Grade Group 2) adenocarcinoma, T2c N0 M0\n\nCurrent Situation:\tInitial oncology assessment\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following referral from the urology team. He was diagnosed following raised PSA of 8.2 in January 2024. Systematic biopsies confirmed Gleason 3+4 disease in 4/12 cores, all from the right lobe. PSMA PET-CT on 15/3/24 showed disease confined to the prostate with no evidence of nodal or distant metastases.\n\nHe remains well with good urinary flow, no nocturia, and stable weight. His only medication is atorvastatin for hypercholesterolemia. Performance status is 0.\n\nWe discussed treatment options in detail including active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, and radical radiotherapy. Given the volume of Gleason 7 disease, he has opted for radical radiotherapy. I have explained the standard protocol of 60Gy in 20 fractions with 6 months of hormone therapy. He will commence hormone therapy next week and radiotherapy planning will be arranged for May 2024.\n\nHe will be reviewed in 4 weeks with initial PSA response. Radiotherapy is planned to commence in late May 2024.",
