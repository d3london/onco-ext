  "content": "Diagnosis:\tRenal cell carcinoma (multilocular cystic type)\n\nManagement:\t12 Apr 2024 Right partial nephrectomy\n\nHistology:\tpT2b N0 M0 multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma, PTEN loss on molecular testing, surgical margins clear\n\nCurrent Situation:\tPost-operative follow-up assessment\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following his recent right partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. The surgery was performed on April 12th by [redacted name], with good recovery and no immediate post-operative complications. The final histology has confirmed a pT2b multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma measuring 8.2cm in maximum dimension, with clear surgical margins. Molecular testing has demonstrated PTEN loss. There was no evidence of lymphovascular invasion or capsular breach.\n\nHe has recovered well from surgery with minimal residual pain and good wound healing. His renal function remains stable with creatinine 98 μmol/L (pre-operative baseline 92). He has returned to most normal activities though still avoiding heavy lifting. His blood pressure is well-controlled at 132/78 mmHg.\n\nOn examination today, his surgical wounds are well-healed with no evidence of infection. His chest is clear and abdomen soft with mild right-sided tenderness only. Performance status remains excellent at ECOG 0.\n\nGiven the histological subtype and complete resection, we have discussed that the prognosis is generally favorable. The plan is for surveillance imaging with CT chest/abdomen/pelvis in 3 months' time, then 6-monthly thereafter if stable. I have provided written information about symptoms to watch for and contact details for the specialist nursing team. We will review him following his next scan.",
