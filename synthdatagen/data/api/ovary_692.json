  "content": "Many thanks for referring [redacted name] to discuss participation in the ENGOT-OV61/RAMP study. She is a 52-year-old lady with low grade serous carcinoma of the ovary, initially diagnosed in January 2024 following investigation of increasing abdominal distension. She underwent primary debulking surgery on February 15th 2024, achieving complete macroscopic resection of disease from the pelvis, but with residual omental disease noted. Histology confirmed low grade serous carcinoma, FIGO stage IIIB, with molecular profiling demonstrating KRAS G12D mutation.\n\nShe completed 3 cycles of carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy between March and May 2024, achieving stable disease on CT assessment. However, given her KRAS mutation status and the availability of the ENGOT-OV61/RAMP trial investigating MEK inhibition in this setting, we have discussed potential trial participation.\n\nI have reviewed her eligibility in detail today. Her performance status remains excellent at ECOG 0. She has no significant comorbidities beyond well-controlled hypertension. Recent blood tests show adequate organ function with normal renal and hepatic parameters. Cardiac assessment including echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular function with ejection fraction of 62%. Her baseline CT from May 15th 2024 shows stable omental disease measuring 2.8 x 1.9cm, which meets the trial criteria for measurable disease.\n\nI have discussed the trial protocol in detail, including the randomisation process, treatment schedule, and required investigations. We reviewed the potential side effects of MEK inhibition including rash, diarrhea, visual disturbances, and cardiac effects. [redacted name] demonstrates good understanding of the trial requirements and has expressed keen interest in participating.\n\nShe has completed the quality of life questionnaires and signed the informed consent forms today. I have arranged the screening investigations including ophthalmology assessment, ECG, and repeat blood tests. Assuming all screening investigations are satisfactory, we plan to proceed with trial registration and randomisation next week. She will then commence the trial medication with weekly reviews initially for safety monitoring.\n\nI have provided written information about the trial and emergency contact details. We have arranged review in the clinical trials unit next week to complete screening and proceed with randomisation if appropriate. She understands to contact us immediately if she develops any concerning symptoms in the meantime.",
