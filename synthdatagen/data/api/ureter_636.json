Transitional cell carcinoma of right ureter with liver metastases and extensive nodal disease\n\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tMarch 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Mar 2024 Diagnostic right ureteroscopy and biopsy\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tNot yet commenced\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tNot yet commenced\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tMolecular profiling completed - TSC2 mutation identified\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tStable metastatic disease\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tRight-sided hydronephrosis\nIntermittent right flank pain\nMild peripheral edema\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tI had the pleasure of meeting [redacted name] today in our uro-oncology clinic. This 67-year-old gentleman has recently been diagnosed with advanced urothelial carcinoma of the right ureter. The diagnosis followed investigations for persistent right-sided flank pain and microscopic hematuria.\n\nInitial CT urogram revealed a 4.8cm mass in the proximal right ureter causing moderate hydronephrosis. Further staging demonstrated multiple enlarged retroperitoneal nodes (largest 3.2cm) and bilobar liver metastases (dominant lesion 5.6cm in segment 7). Ureteroscopic biopsy confirmed high-grade transitional cell carcinoma. Molecular profiling has identified a TSC2 mutation which may have therapeutic implications.\n\nHe is managing reasonably well with WHO performance status 1. His main symptoms are intermittent right flank pain, controlled with regular paracetamol and occasional tramadol. He has developed mild peripheral edema but maintains good urine output. Blood tests show stable renal function with creatinine 132 μmol/L.\n\nOn examination today, there is mild right flank tenderness but no palpable mass. Mild bilateral ankle edema noted. Cardiorespiratory examination unremarkable.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tBaseline cardiac echo requested\nGFR measurement booked\nCT chest/abdomen/pelvis in 6 weeks\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tPanadol Osteo 665mg - two tablets three times daily\nTramadol 50mg - one to two tablets when required\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up will be in 2 weeks with blood results\nUrology review arranged with Mr [redacted name] regarding nephrostomy consideration\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly blood pressure monitoring\nRenal function check in 1 week\n\n\tSummary of information given to the patient\n\tWe have discussed the diagnosis and prognosis at length. I have explained the role of platinum-based combination chemotherapy as first-line treatment, pending cardiac assessment and formal GFR measurement. We have also discussed the potential relevance of the TSC2 mutation for future targeted therapy options.",
