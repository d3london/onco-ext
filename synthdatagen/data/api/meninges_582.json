  "content": "Diagnosis:\nAnaplastic meningioma WHO grade III with bone metastases\n\nPrevious treatment:\nCraniotomy and subtotal resection February 2024\nPost-operative radiotherapy 60Gy in 30 fractions completed April 2024\nStarted Bevacizumab 10mg/kg q2weekly May 2024\n\nPrevious medical history:\nHypertension\nType 2 diabetes\n\nCurrent medications:\nDexamethasone 4mg bd\nLevetiracetam 1g bd\nAmlodipine 10mg od\nMetformin 1g bd\n\nCurrent situation:\nProgressive disease on MRI with new C5 vertebral metastasis\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who attended with his wife. Unfortunately, his most recent MRI brain and spine from 15 June 2024 shows clear disease progression with enlargement of the residual intracranial disease and a new metastatic deposit in the C5 vertebral body. This correlates with his increasing headaches and new neck pain. His performance status has deteriorated to ECOG 2, spending more than 50% of the day resting. He requires assistance with most activities of daily living.\n\nOn examination, there is new left-sided weakness grade 4/5 in both upper and lower limbs. Cranial nerve examination shows stable right-sided third nerve palsy. Recent blood tests show stable renal function with mild thrombocytopenia (platelets 98).\n\nI have discussed these findings with [redacted name] and his wife. Given the clear evidence of disease progression on Bevacizumab after only 6 weeks of treatment, I recommend discontinuing this and switching to combination chemotherapy with Carboplatin and Etoposide. I have explained the aims of treatment are to control disease progression and improve symptoms, though cure is not possible at this stage. We have discussed common side effects including risk of myelosuppression, fatigue, and nausea.\n\nI have arranged urgent palliative radiotherapy to the C5 vertebral metastasis (20Gy in 5 fractions) to start next week. We will commence chemotherapy once radiotherapy is completed. I have increased his dexamethasone to 6mg bd and arranged physiotherapy assessment. [redacted name] will be reviewed again in clinic in 2 weeks with repeat blood tests.",
