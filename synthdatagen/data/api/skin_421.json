The primary lesion was a 2.8mm Breslow thickness ulcerated melanoma of the right calf, with one positive sentinel node from three sampled. Subsequent completion lymphadenectomy showed no additional nodal involvement from 12 nodes examined.\n\nI have discussed at length the role of adjuvant immunotherapy in her situation. Given her high-risk features including ulceration and nodal involvement, she meets criteria for the IMPACT-Mel trial comparing standard adjuvant anti-PD1 therapy versus combination immunotherapy. We have reviewed the trial protocol, potential benefits, and side effect profile of both treatment arms in detail.\n\nShe has completed all screening investigations including CT chest/abdomen/pelvis on 15/4/24 showing no evidence of metastatic disease, and normal baseline blood tests including LFTs, TFTs, and cortisol. Her right groin wound is healing well with minimal seroma.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tBaseline brain MRI scheduled 22/4/24\n\tBaseline cardiac echo and ECG arranged for 24/4/24\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tNone\n\n\tFollow up\n\tTrial randomisation visit scheduled 29/4/24\nFirst treatment planned 2/5/24\nSurgical follow-up with Mr [redacted name] arranged for 3 months\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly blood monitoring as per trial protocol once treatment commences\nUrgent review if immune-related symptoms develop\n\n\tSummary of information given to the patient\n\tFull trial information pack provided\nWritten and verbal information about immunotherapy side effects\nTrial emergency contact card issued",
