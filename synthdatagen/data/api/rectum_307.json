  "content": "Diagnosis:\t\tMetastatic rectal GIST with liver metastases\n\nMolecular:\t\tKIT exon 11 mutation positive\n\nTrial:\t\t\tAVANT-GARDE Phase II study - Arm B (Avapritinib)\n\nCurrent Status:\tCycle 6 Day 1 review\n\n[redacted name] attended for trial assessment today. Tolerating treatment well with continued good partial response. Latest trial-mandated CT on 15/4/24 shows further reduction in liver metastases (target lesion segment 7 now 2.1cm from 3.4cm at baseline, segment 4 lesion 1.8cm from 2.9cm). Primary rectal mass stable at 3.2cm. No new lesions identified.\n\nSide effects remain manageable with grade 1 periorbital edema and occasional grade 1 nausea. Blood pressure well controlled on amlodipine 5mg daily started in cycle 3. Latest trial bloods, ECG, and echocardiogram all satisfactory. ECOG performance status remains 0.\n\nPlan is to continue with cycle 6 Avapritinib 300mg daily as per protocol. Trial coordinator has arranged next assessment visit and CT scan for cycle 9. Will review with results in 6 weeks.",
