  "content": "Diagnosis:\tLeft renal cell carcinoma (acquired cystic disease-associated type)\n\nManagement:\t12 March 2023 Left partial nephrectomy\n\nHistology:\tpT1b (4.5cm) acquired cystic disease-associated renal cell carcinoma, BCL2 positive, margins clear\n\nCurrent Situation:\tRoutine surveillance\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] in the renal oncology follow-up clinic today. He remains well at 14 months post partial nephrectomy with no concerning symptoms. His renal function remains stable with creatinine 156 (baseline 145-160). Recent surveillance CT chest/abdomen/pelvis from 15 April 2024 shows post-surgical changes in the left kidney with no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease. The right kidney shows stable appearance of multiple simple cysts.\n\nHe continues on his usual renal medications and dialysis schedule which he tolerates well. His blood pressure is well controlled on current medications.\n\nThe plan is to continue surveillance with repeat CT in 6 months and clinical review thereafter. I have explained that we will maintain imaging follow-up for 5 years given his underlying renal disease. He understands to contact us sooner if he develops any new concerning symptoms.",
