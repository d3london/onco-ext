He has shown excellent tolerance of treatment with only grade 1 fatigue. His recent CT scan shows encouraging partial response with approximately 40% reduction in peritoneal disease volume compared to baseline. His quality of life has significantly improved with resolution of his previous abdominal pain. Blood tests show no evidence of immune-related adverse events. He remains eligible to continue on trial and I am happy to proceed with cycle 4 today. Next review will be in 3 weeks with repeat blood tests and toxicity assessment as per protocol.",
