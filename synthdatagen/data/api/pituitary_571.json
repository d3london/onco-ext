The 3-month post-operative MRI pituitary from June 2023 showed complete resection with no residual tumor. Endocrine function remains stable with morning cortisol 350 nmol/L and normal thyroid function. Visual fields testing shows continued improvement in the right temporal field deficit. No new symptoms reported. The patient has returned to work full-time and is managing well.\n\nPlan is to continue current hormone replacement and arrange repeat MRI pituitary in 6 months' time with endocrine clinic follow-up.",
