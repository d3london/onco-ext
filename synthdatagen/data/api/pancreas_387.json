TGFBR2 mutation detected.\n\nCurrent situation:\tRoutine surveillance review\n\n[redacted name] attended for routine follow-up today. She has made an excellent recovery following her Whipple's procedure in January. Her post-operative course was uncomplicated and she has now returned to her usual weight of 65kg. Her appetite is good and she is managing a normal diet with pancreatic enzyme replacement. Blood tests show stable liver function and CA19-9 remains within normal range at 12 U/mL. Recent surveillance CT on 15/4/24 shows post-operative changes only with no evidence of recurrence. The plan is to continue 3-monthly surveillance with next CT scan due in July 2024. We will review her again following this scan.",
