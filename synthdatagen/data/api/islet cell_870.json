  "content": "Diagnosis:\t\tMetastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (islet cell)\n\nManagement:\t\tCommenced Lanreotide 120mg q28d March 2024\n\t\tCycle 3 Capecitabine/Temozolomide commenced April 2024\n\nHistology:\t\tWell-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, Ki67 15%, chromogranin A and synaptophysin positive\n\nCurrent Situation:\tPre-cycle 4 CAPTEM review\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today in the neuroendocrine clinic. She is tolerating the combination of Lanreotide and CAPTEM chemotherapy remarkably well. Her initial symptoms of diarrhea and flushing have significantly improved with Lanreotide. The main side effect has been grade 1 hand-foot syndrome from Capecitabine, which she is managing with regular moisturizing. Her most recent CT scan from 15/5/24 shows stable disease in the pancreatic primary (4.2cm) and partial response in the liver metastases with the largest lesion reducing from 3.8cm to 2.9cm. Chromogranin A has decreased from 890 to 450. Performance status remains 1.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 4 CAPTEM today and continue Lanreotide. We will arrange a follow-up CT after cycle 6 to assess response. Next clinic review in 4 weeks with blood tests including chromogranin A, FBC, U&Es, and LFTs.",
