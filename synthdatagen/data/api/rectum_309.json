  "content": "Diagnosis:\tRectal adenocarcinoma, initially cT3N1M0, now ypT0N0M0 following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of adjuvant chemotherapy for rectal cancer. To recap, he was diagnosed in August 2023 with a locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma and received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine. He underwent anterior resection on 15 January 2024, achieving a complete pathological response (ypT0N0M0). He has now completed 4 cycles of adjuvant CAPOX chemotherapy, completing the final cycle on 15 April 2024.\n\nHe has tolerated the treatment well with only grade 1 peripheral neuropathy which is now resolving. His bowel function has normalized with 2-3 formed motions daily. Performance status remains excellent at PS 0. Clinical examination today was unremarkable.\n\nWe have discussed the excellent outcome achieved with treatment, particularly the complete pathological response. The plan is for 3-monthly follow-up with CEA monitoring, and CT chest/abdomen/pelvis every 6 months for the first 2 years as per protocol. I have provided written information about potential late effects and symptoms to watch for. First follow-up CT is arranged for July 2024, and clinic review will be in 3 months with blood tests.",
