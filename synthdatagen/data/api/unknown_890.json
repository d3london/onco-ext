  "content": "Many thanks for referring [redacted name] who I met today accompanied by his wife. He is a 62-year-old gentleman who has unfortunately been diagnosed with mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma following investigation of progressive abdominal distension and weight loss over the past 3 months.\n\nHe initially presented to his GP in January 2024 with early satiety and abdominal discomfort. Following urgent referral, CT imaging on February 15th demonstrated a large primary gastric mass with extensive peritoneal disease and regional lymphadenopathy. Subsequent endoscopic biopsy confirmed mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma with both glandular and neuroendocrine components. Staging investigations including CT chest and MRI brain show no evidence of thoracic or intracranial disease. His serum NSE is significantly elevated at 85 μg/L.\n\nHe has been remarkably stoic throughout his investigations but acknowledges feeling increasingly fatigued. His main symptoms are early satiety and intermittent abdominal discomfort, though he has maintained good oral intake with nutritional supplements. His weight has stabilized at 72kg (down from 84kg three months ago). His performance status remains good at ECOG 1.\n\nIn his past medical history, he has well-controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He takes metformin, ramipril, and recently started omeprazole for symptomatic relief. He lives with his wife and has continued working part-time as an accountant, though with reduced hours due to fatigue.\n\nOn examination today, his abdomen is distended but soft with no acute tenderness. There is shifting dullness suggesting ascites, though this is not currently causing significant symptoms. His chest is clear and heart sounds are normal.\n\nI have had a lengthy discussion with [redacted name] and his wife about the diagnosis and treatment options. Given the mixed histology and extent of disease, I have recommended combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide. We discussed the possibility of adding capecitabine to target the adenocarcinoma component, depending on his tolerance of initial therapy. I have explained the common and serious side effects in detail, including risk of neutropenic sepsis, and provided written information.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with baseline investigations including EDTA clearance, audiometry, and cardiac echo next week. Provided these are satisfactory, we will commence chemotherapy in 2 weeks. I have also referred him to our specialist nurse team for additional support and arranged urgent ascitic drainage if this becomes symptomatic. We will see him again prior to starting treatment to address any questions and confirm final chemotherapy scheduling.\n\nI have explained that we will assess his response after 2-3 cycles with repeat CT imaging and tumor markers. While this is a challenging diagnosis, I have been impressed by his positive attitude and family support network.",
