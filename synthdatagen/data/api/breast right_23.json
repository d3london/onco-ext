  "content": "Diagnosis:\tRight breast cancer - T1cN0M0 mucinous carcinoma\n\nManagement:\t15 Mar 2024 Wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy\n\nHistology:\tGrade 1 mucinous carcinoma, 18mm, clear margins >5mm\n\t\tER 8/8, PR 7/8, HER2 negative, Ki67 12%\n\t\t0/2 sentinel nodes involved\n\nCurrent Situation:\tPost-operative review prior to adjuvant therapy\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following her recent breast surgery. She has made an excellent recovery with good wound healing and no post-operative complications. The final histology confirms a grade 1 mucinous carcinoma with favourable prognostic features.\n\nWe discussed adjuvant treatment options in detail. Given her stage, grade and receptor status, I have recommended adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen for 5 years. The absolute benefit of chemotherapy in her case would be less than 3% and she is happy to proceed without this. Radiotherapy will be arranged to complete local treatment.\n\nI have prescribed tamoxifen 20mg daily to start after radiotherapy completion. She will be referred to the breast radiotherapy team this week and will return to see me in 3 months' time. Annual mammography will be arranged through the breast unit.",
