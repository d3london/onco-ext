  "content": "Diagnosis:\tExtraventricular neurocytoma (WHO grade II)\n\nManagement:\t12 Apr 2024 Stereotactic biopsy of right frontal lesion\n\nHistology:\tExtraventricular neurocytoma WHO grade II\n\tSynaptophysin and NeuN positive\n\tKi-67 proliferation index 3%\n\nCurrent Situation:\tPost-operative review following biopsy\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] following recent stereotactic biopsy of the right frontal lesion. The procedure was uncomplicated and she has made an excellent recovery. She remains neurologically intact with no focal deficits. Her main symptom remains occasional headaches, well controlled with regular paracetamol.\n\nThe histology confirms WHO grade II extraventricular neurocytoma with expected immunohistochemistry profile. The relatively low Ki-67 index is reassuring. MRI brain performed last week shows stable appearance of the 2.8cm right frontal lesion with minimal surrounding edema.\n\nI have discussed the management options with [redacted name] including observation with regular MRI surveillance versus consideration of surgical resection. Given the stable appearances, lack of mass effect, good symptom control, and typically indolent nature of this tumor, we have agreed to proceed with surveillance. We will arrange 3-monthly MRI brain scans initially, extending to 6-monthly if stability is confirmed.\n\nThe plan is to see her again in clinic in 3 months with repeat MRI brain scan.",
