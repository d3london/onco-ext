  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMuscle invasive bladder cancer (glandular variant urothelial carcinoma)\n\tStage T3aN0M0 (AJCC 8th edition)\n\tDiagnosed March 2024\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. He has completed 3 cycles of gemcitabine-cisplatin with good radiological response on recent imaging. The initial staging CT from 15/3/24 showed a 4.8cm posterior wall bladder mass with perivesical fat invasion. Subsequent CT on 24/5/24 shows excellent partial response with residual 1.2cm bladder wall thickening.\n\nHe has tolerated chemotherapy relatively well with grade 1 fatigue and occasional nausea well controlled with standard antiemetics. His renal function has remained stable throughout treatment with latest eGFR 68. Performance status remains 0.\n\nI have discussed his case at our bladder MDT on 27/5/24. Given the good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, he is now appropriate to proceed with radical cystectomy. I have explained this recommendation to [redacted name] who understands the rationale and wishes to proceed. He will be referred back to [redacted name] to arrange surgical assessment and pre-operative workup.\n\nThe plan is to see him again after surgery to discuss adjuvant treatment options based on final pathology. In the meantime, he has contact details for our team should he have any concerns.",
