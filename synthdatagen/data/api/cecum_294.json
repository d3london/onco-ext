She has been managing relatively well on FOLFIRI/Bevacizumab since switching from FOLFOX due to grade 3 peripheral neuropathy. Her latest CT scan from 15 March 2024 shows continued stable disease in the liver metastases, with the largest lesion in segment 7 measuring 3.2cm (previously 3.3cm). Her CEA has remained stable at 45 (previously 48). She reports good energy levels and is maintaining her usual activities, including regular swimming which she finds therapeutic. Her main ongoing challenge is grade 1 mucositis which she manages well with regular mouth care. Her bowels have settled with loperamide as needed.\n\nOn examination today, she looks well with PS 1. Her blood results show stable parameters with hemoglobin 110 g/L and normal liver function. After careful discussion about her stable disease and good tolerability, we have agreed to continue with FOLFIRI/Bevacizumab at current doses. She will have her next CT scan after cycle 9, and we will see her again in clinic in 3 weeks' time with blood tests.",
