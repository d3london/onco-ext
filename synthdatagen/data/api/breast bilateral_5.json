She has made a good recovery from her operations with wounds healing well. She reports mild post-operative pain managed with regular paracetamol. No concerns regarding arm mobility or lymphoedema.\n\nOn examination, surgical sites are healing appropriately with no evidence of infection or seroma. No palpable axillary nodes. Normal arm movement bilaterally.\n\nHistology confirms left breast Grade 2 tubular carcinoma, 3.2cm, with 4/12 positive axillary nodes. Right breast shows 1.8cm Grade 2 tubular carcinoma with 0/2 sentinel nodes positive. Both tumors are strongly ER positive (90%) and PR positive (85%).
