Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, right kidney lower pole\n\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tMarch 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tCurative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t15 Mar 2024 Right partial nephrectomy performed by Mr [redacted name]\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tNot indicated\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tNot indicated\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tNo evidence of disease\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tPost-operative recovery\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 58-year-old gentleman was referred following right partial nephrectomy for an incidentally detected renal mass. The surgery was uncomplicated with good preservation of renal function. Histology confirms a 4.2cm chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, completely excised with clear margins. Immunohistochemistry shows CD10 positivity. Staging CT chest/abdomen/pelvis shows no evidence of metastatic disease.\n\nHe has made an excellent post-operative recovery with good wound healing and stable renal function (creatinine 98). His main symptom is mild residual right-sided discomfort which is improving. He has returned to most normal activities and has resumed work as an accountant.\n\nOn examination today, his surgical wound is well-healed. His blood pressure is 138/82 and other observations are within normal range. Cardiorespiratory examination is unremarkable.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tRoutine surveillance imaging as per protocol\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tNone required\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up in 3 months with repeat CT chest/abdomen/pelvis\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPlease monitor blood pressure and renal function\n\n\tSummary of information given to the patient\n\tWe have discussed the good prognosis associated with completely resected chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. [redacted name] understands the surveillance plan which involves regular imaging and monitoring of renal function.",
