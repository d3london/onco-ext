The post-operative period has been uncomplicated with excellent recovery. Blood pressure has normalized without need for antihypertensive medication. Surgical wound has healed well.\n\nPlasma normetanephrine levels have returned to normal range at 420 pmol/L (previously 4500 pmol/L). CT scan on 20 April 2024 shows no evidence of residual or recurrent disease. Performance status is 0.\n\nGiven the identified SDHA mutation, genetic counselling has been arranged and family screening will be coordinated through the endocrine genetics service.\n\nPlan is for biochemical surveillance with 3-monthly plasma metanephrines for the first year. Next clinic review in 3 months with repeat biochemistry. Annual CT surveillance will be arranged.",
