She has completed 3 months of adjuvant CAPOX chemotherapy which finished on 12/6/24. She is recovering well with improving energy levels and has returned to work part-time. Her bowel function has normalized and she reports no ongoing symptoms. Her weight is stable at 68kg.\n\nHer latest blood tests from 1/7/24 show normal CEA at 2.4 and stable liver function. We have arranged CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for September 2024 as per protocol. The plan is to continue regular 3-monthly follow-up with alternating clinical review and imaging for the first two years. I have provided written information about surveillance and symptoms to watch for. She will be reviewed again in clinic in October with her scan results.",
