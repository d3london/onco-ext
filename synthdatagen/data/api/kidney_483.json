She has made an excellent recovery from surgery with no ongoing symptoms. Her wound has healed well and she has returned to normal activities. Blood pressure is well controlled at 132/78mmHg. Renal function remains stable with creatinine 92 umol/L. Recent CT chest/abdomen/pelvis on 15/4/24 shows no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease, and the post-surgical changes in the right kidney are as expected. The plan is to continue surveillance as per protocol with next imaging in 6 months. She will be reviewed in clinic following those results. She understands to contact us sooner if she develops any new concerning symptoms.",
