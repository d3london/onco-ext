She has recovered well from treatment with resolution of previous chemotherapy-related fatigue and nausea. Her appetite has improved and weight has stabilized at 65kg. Serum AFP has normalized from previous peak of 2500 ng/mL to 12 ng/mL. Recent surveillance CT shows no evidence of disease recurrence. Blood tests show stable liver function and normal CA19-9. The plan is to continue regular surveillance with 3-monthly AFP measurements and CT scan in 3 months' time. She will be reviewed in clinic following these investigations.",
