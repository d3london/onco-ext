  "content": "Diagnosis:\tLocally advanced HER2-positive adenocarcinoma of lower esophagus (ypT3N1M0)\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of cycle 4 of perioperative FLOT chemotherapy with concurrent trastuzumab. He completed neoadjuvant treatment in March 2024 followed by Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy on April 15th 2024, with good post-operative recovery. Histology confirmed ypT3N1 disease with 2/18 nodes positive, clear resection margins (R0), and moderate treatment response (TRG 2).\n\nHe is managing relatively well with the current chemotherapy regimen though experiencing ongoing grade 2 peripheral neuropathy affecting his hands and feet, particularly noticeable when handling cold items. His swallowing has gradually improved post-surgery and he is now managing a soft diet with good nutritional intake. Weight has stabilized at 72kg (pre-treatment weight 78kg). He continues with regular physiotherapy exercises and can now walk for 30 minutes daily.\n\nOn examination today, his surgical wounds are well healed. Chest is clear with good bilateral air entry. Performance status remains 1. Blood results show stable parameters with hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, platelets 156, neutrophils 2.8, and normal renal and liver function.\n\nWe had a detailed discussion about the remaining treatment course. Given the node-positive disease at surgery and his good tolerance of treatment, we plan to complete the full perioperative protocol with 4 more cycles of FLOT/trastuzumab. However, due to the persistent neuropathy, we will implement a 20% dose reduction of oxaliplatin. I have prescribed cycle 5 for next week and arranged weekly clinical review during treatment.\n\nHe will have a progress CT scan after completing all treatment, followed by 3-monthly surveillance imaging for the first year. I have also referred him to our specialist nurse-led clinic for ongoing support with post-esophagectomy symptoms and nutrition.",
