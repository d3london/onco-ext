  "content": "Diagnosis:\tBiphasic peritoneal mesothelioma\n\nManagement:\t15 Jan 2024 Diagnostic laparoscopy and peritoneal biopsies\n\t\t1 Feb 2024 Commenced pemetrexed/cisplatin chemotherapy\n\nHistology:\tBiphasic mesothelioma, MTAP loss, BAP1 retained\n\nCurrent Situation:\tPre-cycle 4 pemetrexed/cisplatin\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today in the mesothelioma clinic. He has completed three cycles of pemetrexed and cisplatin chemotherapy with encouraging response. His initial presenting symptoms of abdominal discomfort and early satiety have significantly improved. The most recent CT scan on 15 April 2024 shows partial response with reduction in peritoneal disease bulk and no new sites of disease. His performance status remains excellent at PS 0.\n\nHe has tolerated treatment well with only grade 1 fatigue and occasional nausea well controlled with standard antiemetics. His renal function remains stable with latest eGFR 85, and his hearing test shows no deterioration. His latest blood results show stable parameters with hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL and platelets 245.\n\nWe have discussed continuing with cycle 4 of chemotherapy today. He understands to maintain good oral hydration and to contact us if he develops any new symptoms or concerns. We will arrange a progress CT scan after cycle 6 to assess response. I will see him again in three weeks for cycle 5.",
