She has made an excellent recovery from treatment with resolution of previous radiation pneumonitis. Her appetite and energy levels have significantly improved, and she has regained 3kg of weight. She denies any new respiratory symptoms or concerning features.\n\nCT thorax performed last week shows excellent partial response with >50% reduction in the right lower lobe primary mass and resolution of previous mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Brain MRI shows no evidence of metastatic disease.\n\nThe plan is to continue regular surveillance with 3-monthly CT imaging. I have arranged follow up in clinic in 3 months with repeat CT chest. She understands to contact us sooner if any new symptoms develop.",
