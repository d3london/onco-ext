Right upper lobe lung cancer, Stage IIIB\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tCurative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\tNot indicated\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tCompleted radical chemoradiotherapy March 2024\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tCompleted concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy March 2024\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tWorsening dyspnoea, weight loss\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who has unfortunately experienced clinical deterioration since completing radical chemoradiotherapy in March. She reports worsening breathlessness on minimal exertion and has lost a further 3kg in weight despite dietary supplementation. Her performance status has declined from 1 to 2.\n\nOn examination today, there are new signs of superior vena cava obstruction with prominent neck veins and facial plethora. Chest examination reveals reduced air entry in the right upper zone with surrounding bronchial breathing.\n\nThe recent CT scan from 15/4/24 shows enlargement of the right upper lobe mass from 4.5cm to 6.2cm with new mediastinal lymphadenopathy causing SVC compression. Given the high PD-L1 expression (100%), I have discussed commencing pembrolizumab immunotherapy.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tUrgent MRI brain\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tDexamethasone 8mg BD for SVC obstruction\n\n\tFollow up\n\tUrgent review next week with scan results\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPlease monitor blood glucose while on steroids",
