She is a remarkably positive 62-year-old lady who has unfortunately been diagnosed with this rare mixed histology renal pelvis cancer. Her journey began in January with episodes of visible haematuria, initially attributed to infection but persisting despite antibiotics. She underwent urgent investigation through the haematuria clinic leading to the current diagnosis.\n\nShe has maintained excellent functional status throughout, continuing her work as a primary school teacher part-time and managing regular swimming three times weekly. Her only current symptom is mild right-sided flank discomfort, well controlled with regular paracetamol. She describes some anxiety about the diagnosis but is coping well with support from her family.\n\nOn examination today, she appears well with PS 0. There is mild right-sided costovertebral angle tenderness but no palpable mass. Chest examination is clear and there are no concerning features in other systems.\n\nI have had detailed discussions with [redacted name] and her husband about management options. Given the oligometastatic presentation and her excellent performance status, I have recommended combination platinum-based chemotherapy with consideration of consolidation local therapy to both primary and metastatic sites if good response is achieved. We discussed gemcitabine and cisplatin in detail, including common and rare side effects.\n\nI have arranged baseline cardiac echo, audiometry and renal function testing prior to chemotherapy. She will be reviewed in our specialist nurse clinic next week for chemotherapy education and port insertion planning. I have also referred her case for discussion at our specialist uro-oncology MDT next week to confirm the treatment approach.\n\nThe plan is to commence chemotherapy in 2 weeks pending investigation results and MDT discussion. We will arrange CT reassessment after 3 cycles to guide subsequent management. I have also referred [redacted name] to our clinical psychology team for additional support during treatment.",
