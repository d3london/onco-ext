She is tolerating treatment well with only grade 1 palmar-plantar syndrome which is effectively managed with regular moisturizing. Her surgical sites have healed excellently with no evidence of complications. Clinical examination today shows no concerning features at either mastectomy site or axillae. Blood parameters remain within normal range and she is maintaining good oral intake with stable weight. Performance status remains 0.\n\nI am pleased to proceed with cycle 4 of capecitabine at full dose. We will arrange CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after completion of chemotherapy as baseline imaging for future surveillance. She will be reviewed again in clinic prior to cycle 5 in three weeks' time.",
