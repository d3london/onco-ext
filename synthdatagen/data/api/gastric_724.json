Given the high-risk features (T4 disease, nodal involvement, Ki67 80%), the consensus recommendation is for adjuvant platinum-etoposide chemotherapy. The proposed regimen is 6 cycles of carboplatin AUC 5 and etoposide 100mg/m2. Patient to be reviewed in medical oncology clinic next week for chemotherapy discussion. Routine surveillance imaging to be arranged at 3-monthly intervals.\n\nPlan:\t\tMedical oncology review 22 March 2024\n\t\tBaseline CT chest/abdomen/pelvis prior to chemotherapy\n\t\tRoutine chromogranin A monitoring",
