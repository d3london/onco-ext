  "content": "Many thanks for referring [redacted name] whom I reviewed today following the recent MDT discussion. He is a 62-year-old gentleman who underwent a staging laparoscopy on 15th March 2024 confirming a T3N1M0 gastric adenocarcinoma, diffuse type. The staging CT showed a 6.8cm gastric mass with several enlarged perigastric nodes but no evidence of distant metastatic disease. Molecular analysis has confirmed MSI-high status with PD-L1 CPS of 20.\n\nI am pleased to report that [redacted name] has been deemed eligible for the PARADIGM-2 trial, comparing standard perioperative FLOT chemotherapy with FLOT plus durvalumab. He has completed all screening investigations including cardiac echo showing normal systolic function (EF 62%), satisfactory pulmonary function tests, and baseline CT imaging. Blood results show adequate organ function with normal renal and hepatic parameters.\n\nI have had a detailed discussion with [redacted name] regarding the trial protocol, potential benefits, and risks. He understands that he will be randomized to either standard FLOT chemotherapy alone or FLOT with immunotherapy. We reviewed the schedule of 4 pre-operative and 4 post-operative cycles, with restaging after the initial 4 cycles. The common and rare side effects of both chemotherapy and immunotherapy were discussed, including the risk of immune-related adverse events with durvalumab.\n\nHe has completed the quality of life questionnaires and signed the informed consent forms today. His baseline performance status is 0 and he remains very active, walking 3 miles daily. Current weight is stable at 78kg. Examination shows mild epigastric tenderness but no other concerning features.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 1 of treatment next week following randomization. He will have weekly blood tests for the first cycle and then regular reviews as per protocol. CT reassessment is scheduled after 4 cycles, approximately week 12. I have provided emergency contact details and arrangements are in place for toxicity monitoring through our clinical trials team. We will see him again next week to commence treatment and then regularly throughout his treatment course as per trial protocol.\n?\n",
