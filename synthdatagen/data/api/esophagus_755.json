Small cell carcinoma of esophagus with liver and lung metastases\n\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\tNot indicated\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t1. Carboplatin/Etoposide Jan-Mar 2024 - 4 cycles completed\n\t2. Second line Topotecan commenced April 2024\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tNot yet received\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNot eligible\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease in liver and new bone metastases\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Worsening dysphagia\n\t2. Right upper quadrant pain\n\t3. Increasing fatigue\n\t4. Weight loss\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tUnfortunately [redacted name] has experienced significant clinical deterioration over the past three weeks. Following initial response to first-line carboplatin/etoposide, recent CT on 15/5/24 shows disease progression with 30% increase in liver metastases and new bone metastases in T8 and L2 vertebrae. Despite commencing second-line topotecan four weeks ago, she reports worsening dysphagia now requiring liquid diet, new right upper quadrant pain, and increasing fatigue with ECOG PS declining from 2 to 3.\n\nOn examination today, she appears cachectic with tender hepatomegaly and reduced chest expansion. Weight has dropped from 62kg to 56kg over 6 weeks. Oxygen saturations 94% on room air.\n\nI have had a detailed discussion with [redacted name] and her daughter about disease progression and poor response to second-line treatment. We have agreed to discontinue topotecan given lack of benefit and declining performance status.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\t1. Urgent MRI spine to assess bone metastases\n\t2. Speech and language therapy assessment for dysphagia\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\t1. Increased dexamethasone to 4mg bd\n\t2. Commenced oxycodone MR 10mg bd\n\t3. Continued lansoprazole 30mg od\n\n\tFollow up\n\t1. Urgent palliative care review arranged for tomorrow\n\t2. Oncology review in 1 week\n\t3. District nurse referral completed\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\t1. Please monitor pain control\n\t2. Consider prophylactic antibiotics if neutropenic\n\t3. Support palliative care involvement",
