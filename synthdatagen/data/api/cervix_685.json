Glassy cell carcinoma of cervix FIGO Stage IVA with bladder invasion\n\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tCurative intent\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\tNot suitable due to local extent\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\t12 Feb 2024 - 22 Mar 2024\n\tRadical chemoradiotherapy 50.4Gy in 28 fractions with weekly cisplatin\n\tBrachytherapy boost 21Gy in 3 fractions completed 5 Apr 2024\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\tCompleted 5 cycles concurrent cisplatin (one omitted due to neutropenia)\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tStable disease on first post-treatment imaging\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\tGrade 2 radiation proctitis\nMild lymphoedema both legs\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tCase discussed at Gynae-oncology MDT today. MRI pelvis from 15/4/24 shows good response to chemoradiotherapy with reduction in cervical mass from 6.8cm to 2.1cm. Bladder wall thickening improved but residual abnormality present. No new disease sites. PET-CT from 18/4/24 shows residual FDG uptake in primary site (SUV max 4.2, reduced from 12.8) with no distant disease.\n\nThe MDT recommendations are:\n1. Continue observation with close surveillance given overall good response\n2. Arrange cystoscopy to assess bladder involvement\n3. Consider maintenance immunotherapy given high PD-L1 status (CPS 90)\n4. Early referral to lymphoedema service\n\nPatient to be reviewed in clinic next week to discuss MDT outcome and ongoing management plan.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tCystoscopy\nRepeat MRI pelvis in 8 weeks\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tHydrocortisone suppositories for radiation proctitis\n\n\tFollow up\n\tNext oncology follow up in 1 week\nLymphoedema service referral completed\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tWeekly FBC, U&E monitoring\nPrescribe compression stockings as per lymphoedema team advice",
