  "content": "Diagnosis:\tProstate adenocarcinoma T2b N0 M0, diagnosed March 2024\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today in the prostate cancer clinic. He is currently on cycle 3 of docetaxel chemotherapy as part of his treatment plan. His initial PSA was 6.9 at diagnosis, and latest PSA has shown good response dropping to 2.1. Molecular testing revealed CHEK1 mutation.\n\nHe is tolerating the chemotherapy reasonably well with grade 1 fatigue and mild peripheral neuropathy affecting his fingertips. No significant nausea or other toxicities. Performance status remains 0. Blood results today show stable FBC and biochemistry with neutrophils 2.8 and normal LFTs.\n\nOn examination, he remains well with no concerning features. Digital rectal examination shows reduced prominence of the original lesion at the prostatic base.\n\nHe will continue with planned docetaxel, with next cycle due in 3 weeks. We will see him again prior to cycle 4 with repeat PSA measurement.",
