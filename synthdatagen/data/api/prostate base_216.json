  "content": "Diagnosis\n\t1. Metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma with ductal features\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\tNone indicated\n\n\tSystemic therapy\n\t1. ADT commenced January 2024 - Leuprorelin 3-monthly\n\t2. Docetaxel chemotherapy commenced February 2024 - discontinued after 2 cycles due to clinical deterioration\n\t3. Enzalutamide 160mg daily started April 2024\n\n\tRadiotherapy\n\tPalliative radiotherapy to T8 vertebra March 2024\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNot eligible\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease with rising PSA and new bone pain\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Worsening bone pain\n\t2. Progressive fatigue\n\t3. Urinary symptoms with intermittent catheterisation\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tUnfortunately [redacted name] has shown evidence of disease progression despite recent initiation of enzalutamide. His PSA has risen from 567 to 890 over the past 4 weeks. He describes new onset pain in his right hip and increasing lower back pain. His mobility has significantly declined and he now requires a wheelchair for anything more than short distances. Performance status has deteriorated to ECOG 3.\n\nOn examination, there is marked tenderness over the right hip and lumbar spine. Neurological examination shows no focal deficits but power is generally reduced due to pain and deconditioning.\n\nGiven the MMR-deficient status of his tumor, we have discussed starting pembrolizumab immunotherapy. I have explained the rationale, potential benefits and side effects in detail. He wishes to proceed with this option.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tUrgent CT scan to exclude spinal cord compression\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\t1. Increased MST to 60mg BD\n\t2. Added pregabalin 75mg BD for neuropathic pain\n\n\tFollow up\n\tUrgent review in 1 week with scan results\nReferral to palliative care team made today\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPlease monitor renal function weekly\nConsider community physiotherapy referral",
