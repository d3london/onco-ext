  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMuscle invasive bladder adenocarcinoma, stage pT2N0M0\n\nI was very pleased to see [redacted name] in clinic today following completion of his neoadjuvant chemotherapy. He has shown remarkable resilience throughout his treatment journey since his initial diagnosis in January 2024. The original staging investigations confirmed a muscle-invasive bladder adenocarcinoma, with TURBT on 15/01/24 showing invasion into muscularis propria. Molecular testing confirmed MSI-stable status with preserved mismatch repair protein expression.\n\nHe has completed 3 cycles of gemcitabine-cisplatin neoadjuvant chemotherapy, tolerating this remarkably well with only grade 1 fatigue and occasional nausea well-controlled with standard antiemetics. His most recent CT scan on 15/04/24 shows an excellent partial response with significant reduction in the bladder wall thickening from 2.8cm to 1.2cm, and no evidence of nodal or metastatic disease.\n\nHe remains in good spirits and his performance status is excellent at PS 0. He has maintained his weight and exercise routine throughout chemotherapy, continuing his daily 3-mile walks. On examination today, he looks very well with no concerning features. His blood tests show stable renal function with eGFR 65 and normal liver function.\n\nI have had detailed discussions with [redacted name] and his wife regarding the next phase of treatment. Given the excellent response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we have agreed to proceed with radical cystectomy as planned. I have explained that this represents the best chance of cure in his situation. He understands the implications of surgery and has already had detailed discussions with the surgical team about post-operative recovery and stoma care.\n\nThe plan is for [redacted name] to be reviewed in the surgical clinic next week to schedule his operation, aiming for surgery in early May 2024. We will then see him back in the oncology clinic approximately 6-8 weeks post-surgery to review his final pathology and discuss any need for adjuvant treatment. He has all the relevant contact numbers and understands to contact us if he has any concerns in the meantime.",
