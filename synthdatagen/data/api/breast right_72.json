She was accompanied today by her sister who has been providing excellent support. The diagnosis was made through the breast screening program, where a small area of concern was identified in the right breast. Following core biopsy confirmation of malignancy, she underwent right breast wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy on March 15th, 2024.\n\nThe final histology shows a 7mm grade 2 adenomyoepithelial carcinoma, completely excised with clear margins (nearest margin >5mm). Sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative (0/2 nodes). The tumor is ER positive (8/8), PR positive (7/8), HER2 positive (3+), with Ki67 of 15%.\n\nShe has recovered very well from surgery with minimal post-operative pain. The wound is healing nicely with no signs of infection. She remains very active, walking 30 minutes daily, and has excellent support from her family.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tBaseline cardiac ECHO and ECG arranged\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tNone required currently\n\n\tFollow up\n\tBreast clinic in 2 weeks for wound check\nOncology review in 3 weeks with cardiac investigations\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tNone required\n\n\tSummary of information given to the patient\n\tWe had a detailed discussion about adjuvant treatment recommendations. Given the tumor biology (HER2 positive status), I have explained the benefit of chemotherapy with anti-HER2 therapy, followed by radiotherapy and hormonal therapy. Written information provided about treatment options. [redacted name] understands the curative intent of treatment and appears to have good understanding of the planned pathway.",
