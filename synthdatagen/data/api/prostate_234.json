  "content": "Many thanks for referring [redacted name] for urgent MDT discussion. This 62-year-old gentleman was diagnosed with prostate carcinosarcoma in January 2024 following investigation of back pain and weight loss. Initial PSA was markedly elevated at 2345. Molecular profiling has shown RB1 loss and high neuroendocrine markers. Unfortunately, staging investigations revealed extensive metastatic disease with widespread bone metastases, multiple liver deposits, and bilateral lung nodules.\n\nHe initially commenced on Docetaxel chemotherapy with concurrent ADT in February 2024, but unfortunately developed rapid clinical deterioration after cycle 1 with rising PSA to 3456 and new onset right upper quadrant pain. Repeat CT on 15/3/24 showed marked progression of liver metastases with largest lesion now 8.2cm compared to 4.5cm previously. There is also new malignant pleural effusion.\n\nHe was admitted last week with grade 3 neutropenia, severe fatigue, and respiratory compromise requiring pleural drainage. His performance status has declined from 1 to 3. The case was discussed at today's Uro-oncology MDT with input from medical oncology, clinical oncology, and palliative care teams.\n\nGiven the aggressive disease progression, poor treatment response, and current clinical deterioration, the MDT recommendation is for cessation of systemic anti-cancer therapy. The focus should be on symptom control and supportive care. I have arranged urgent palliative care review and discussed with the acute oncology team regarding admission for symptom management if required. We will keep him under weekly telephone review and arrange urgent clinic review if his condition stabilizes.\n\nThe patient and family have been informed of the MDT outcome by Dr [redacted name] who will continue to coordinate his care with support from the palliative care team.",
