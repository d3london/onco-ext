  "content": "Diagnosis:\nExtrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, stage IIA (T2bN0M0)\n\nSurgery:\n15 January 2024 - Whipple's procedure\n\nHistology:\nModerately differentiated cholangiocarcinoma, R0 resection margins, no lymphovascular invasion. FGFR mutation negative.\n\nPrevious medical history:\nType 2 diabetes\nHypertension\n\nCurrent medications:\nGemcitabine/Cisplatin adjuvant chemotherapy\nMetformin\nRamipril\n\nCurrent situation:\nCycle 4 of 6 planned cycles adjuvant Gemcitabine/Cisplatin\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today who is tolerating adjuvant chemotherapy well. Blood tests show stable renal function and acceptable haematological parameters. Latest CT scan from 15 April 2024 shows post-operative changes only with no evidence of recurrence. Liver function tests remain within normal range.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 5 today and arrange follow-up CT chest/abdomen/pelvis prior to final cycle. We will see her again in clinic in 3 weeks time before cycle 6.",
