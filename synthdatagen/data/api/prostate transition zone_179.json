Underwent template prostate biopsies on 15 February 2024 confirming diagnosis.\n\n[redacted name] attended for routine follow-up today. He completed his radical radiotherapy course (74Gy in 37 fractions) on 12 April 2024 and has recovered well with minimal side effects. His urinary symptoms have largely settled, though he reports occasional mild frequency. Bowel function has returned to normal.\n\nHis latest PSA has fallen appropriately to 2.1 ng/mL (15 May 2024). Clinical examination today was unremarkable.\n\nHe remains well with PS 0 and has returned to his usual activities including regular golf.\n\nThe plan is to continue on his current hormone therapy (Prostap 3-monthly) for a total of 2 years as previously discussed. His next injection is due in 3 weeks. We will review him again in clinic in 3 months with repeat PSA.",
