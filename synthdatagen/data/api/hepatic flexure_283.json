Performance status has declined to ECOG 2. Recent CT (15/05/2024) shows progression with new liver lesions and increase in pulmonary metastases despite 2 cycles of pembrolizumab. Liver function shows new derangement with bilirubin 45, ALT 156.\n\nGiven rapid progression and declining performance status, we have discussed changing approach to focus on symptom control. I have referred to palliative care team and arranged urgent review with our hepatobiliary team regarding potential need for biliary stenting. Will see again next week with results. Patient understands prognosis is now measured in weeks to months.",
