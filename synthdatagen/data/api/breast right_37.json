She has recovered well from both surgery and radiotherapy, with only mild residual skin changes in the treated area which are improving with regular moisturizer. Her right arm mobility has returned to normal following the physiotherapy exercises. She reports good energy levels and has returned to her usual activities. The surgical wound has healed well with no complications.\n\nOn examination today, there is mild skin pigmentation in the radiotherapy field but no concerning features. No palpable masses or lymphadenopathy identified. She will commence tamoxifen 20mg daily from today as planned.\n\nThe plan is for routine follow-up in 4 months with mammogram surveillance to begin at 1 year post-surgery. She understands to contact us sooner if any new concerns arise.",
