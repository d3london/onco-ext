  "content": "Diagnosis:\tLocally advanced adenosquamous carcinoma of esophagus, ypT2N0M0\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following completion of his adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. He completed 5 cycles of carboplatin/paclitaxel with concurrent radiotherapy on 15 March 2024, having commenced treatment on 15 January 2024. The final cycle was omitted due to grade 2 thrombocytopenia.\n\nHe initially presented in October 2023 with dysphagia and underwent neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with 3 cycles FLOT followed by Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy on 12 December 2023. Pathology showed ypT2N0 adenosquamous carcinoma with clear margins. PDL1 CPS was 12 and MMR proficient.\n\nHe has made an excellent recovery from treatment. His swallowing has significantly improved and he is now managing a normal diet. His weight has stabilized at 72kg (up from nadir of 68kg). Performance status is 1. He reports mild residual fatigue but this is improving week by week. No other significant toxicities remain.\n\nOn examination today, his surgical wounds are well healed. Chest is clear. No concerning features.\n\nThe plan is for surveillance with 3-monthly CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for the first year, alternating with clinical review. First scan booked for June 2024. He has been given contact details for the specialist nurse team and understands to report any new symptoms promptly.",
