  "content": "I reviewed [redacted name] today who has unfortunately shown clear evidence of disease progression. As you know, she was diagnosed with pleomorphic carcinoma of the right lung in January 2024, initially presenting with a 8.5cm right upper lobe mass with extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy and widespread bone metastases. Her initial PD-L1 was notably high at 90%. She commenced first-line pembrolizumab-carboplatin-pemetrexed in February 2024, completing 4 cycles with initial good partial response evidenced on CT chest March 2024 showing 40% reduction in primary mass size.\n\nUnfortunately, she presented to A&E on 15th April 2024 with new onset severe headaches, confusion, and diplopia. MRI brain confirmed extensive leptomeningeal disease. CSF cytology was positive for malignant cells. She was commenced on high-dose dexamethasone with good initial symptomatic improvement. Her performance status has declined significantly to ECOG 3, spending most of the day in bed or chair. She describes ongoing headaches despite dexamethasone, though less severe than at presentation, and has developed right-sided facial weakness. She has also noted increasing breathlessness on minimal exertion.\n\nOn examination today, there is reduced air entry throughout the right hemithorax with dullness to percussion. Neurological examination confirms a right sixth nerve palsy and right-sided facial weakness. CT chest performed yesterday shows significant progression of primary disease with new pleural effusion and increase in mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Given the development of carcinomatous meningitis and overall clinical deterioration, we have discussed at length with [redacted name] and her family about changing approach to focus on quality of life and symptom control.\n\nWe have discontinued systemic anti-cancer therapy and I have made an urgent referral to the palliative care team. She will continue on dexamethasone 8mg twice daily with PPI cover. I have prescribed additional medications for symptom control including oxycodone for breakthrough pain. We have also arranged urgent radiotherapy assessment for possible whole brain radiotherapy. The acute oncology team will maintain close follow-up and I have provided emergency contact details. I have discussed the case with her GP Dr [redacted name] who will arrange increased community support.",
