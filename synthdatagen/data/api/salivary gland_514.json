She has recovered well from her surgery with no facial nerve weakness. The surgical site has healed well with minimal scarring. She reports no new symptoms and examination today shows no evidence of recurrence. Her latest MRI from 12 April 2024 confirms no evidence of disease. Blood tests are satisfactory.\n\nThe plan is to continue regular surveillance. I will arrange follow-up in 3 months with repeat imaging at 6 months as per protocol.",
