  "content": "Diagnosis:\nSquamous cell carcinoma of rectum, T2N0M0\nDiagnosed March 2024\nHPV positive, PD-L1 CPS 95\n\nPrevious medical history:\nNil significant\n\nCurrent medications:\nNone regular\n\nAllergies:\nNo known drug allergies\n\nCurrent situation:\nRecently diagnosed following investigation of altered bowel habit\n\nImaging:\nMRI pelvis 15/03/24 - T2 rectal tumor at 8cm from anal verge, no extramural invasion\nCT chest/abdomen/pelvis 20/03/24 - no evidence of metastatic disease\n\nHistology:\nEndoscopic biopsy 10/03/24 confirms moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, HPV positive\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the rectum. This is an unusual histological subtype, and the case has been discussed at our specialist MDT. Given the HPV positivity and high PD-L1 expression, there was consensus for treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy as primary treatment.\n\nOn examination today, performance status is 0. Digital rectal examination confirms a firm tumor at 8cm. No concerning lymphadenopathy. Normal liver span.\n\nI have explained the proposed treatment plan of concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy with radical radiotherapy. We will arrange baseline blood tests, EDTA clearance, and audiometry prior to starting treatment. [redacted name] understands the common side effects including fatigue, diarrhea, and skin reactions. Treatment is planned to start in 2 weeks following dental assessment and radiotherapy planning scan.",
