The initial post-operative period was complicated by mild ileus which resolved with conservative management. He has now fully adapted to managing his ileal conduit and reports good energy levels with return to daily walking.?\n\nHis post-operative CT scan shows no evidence of disease. Blood tests including renal function are satisfactory. Performance status has returned to 0.?\n\nWe have discussed surveillance plans. He will have 3-monthly reviews for the first year with CT chest/abdomen/pelvis at 3, 6 and 12 months. First scan due July 2024. I will see him again with scan results in 3 months' time. He has contact details for the stoma nurses and understands to contact us sooner if any concerns develop.",
