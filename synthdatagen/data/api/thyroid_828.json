She remains well following completion of treatment last year. Her thyroid function is well controlled on Levothyroxine 125mcg daily. Recent thyroglobulin level is <0.1 (suppressed) and thyroglobulin antibodies are negative. Neck examination shows well-healed thyroidectomy scar with no concerning features. No palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. Latest ultrasound neck on 15/3/24 shows no evidence of recurrence. She will continue on current Levothyroxine dose with biochemistry monitoring through endocrinology team. Plan for next follow-up in 6 months with repeat thyroglobulin level and neck ultrasound.",
