  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMetastatic spindle cell carcinoma of rectum\n\nManagement:\t15 Jan 2024 Low anterior resection\n\t\t02 Feb 2024 Started FOLFOX/Bevacizumab\n\t\t20 Mar 2024 Ceased FOLFOX due to progression\n\nHistology:\tSpindle cell carcinoma, T4aN2 (6/12 nodes), MMR proficient, PD-L1 CPS 85\n\nCurrent Situation:\tDisease progression on first-line therapy\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following recent CT showing clear disease progression. The scan demonstrates new pulmonary nodules with largest now measuring 2.8cm (previously 1.2cm) and growth in liver metastases with segment 7 lesion increasing from 3.5cm to 5.2cm. Performance status has declined to ECOG 2 due to increasing fatigue and right upper quadrant pain. Weight has dropped by 4kg since last review.\n\nBlood results show rising CEA at 245 (previously 180) and deteriorating liver function with bilirubin 35, ALT 125.\n\nI have discussed these findings with [redacted name] and family. Given the rapid progression and declining performance status, I have recommended discontinuing FOLFOX/Bevacizumab and transitioning to second-line irinotecan/ramucirumab. I have explained the aims and potential side effects of this regimen.\n\nPlan is to commence treatment next week pending final blood results. Will arrange urgent CT reassessment after 2 cycles. Have also referred to palliative care for additional support with symptom management. Review in 2 weeks with blood tests.",
