She is tolerating anastrozole well with only mild joint stiffness managed with regular exercise. Her breast symptoms have settled following radiotherapy with no ongoing concerns. Clinical examination shows good cosmetic outcome with no suspicious findings in either breast or axillae. Recent mammogram on 15/4/24 shows post-treatment changes only. Blood tests including liver function are satisfactory. She will continue anastrozole and return to clinic in 6 months with repeat blood tests.",
