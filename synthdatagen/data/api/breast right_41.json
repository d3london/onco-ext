She has completed two cycles of protocol therapy with ribociclib and letrozole. Her main symptoms have been fatigue, particularly in the evenings, though this has improved from grade 2 to grade 1 over the past week. She reports good compliance with the oral medications. Her back pain has significantly improved following palliative radiotherapy, now only requiring occasional paracetamol.\n\nHer blood tests today show neutrophils 1.2 x 10^9/L (Grade 2), which is an improvement from 0.9 last week. Liver function tests remain within normal range. ECG shows no significant changes with QTc 440ms.\n\nAs per trial protocol, we have completed the Quality of Life questionnaires and toxicity assessment.
