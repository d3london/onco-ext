  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMetastatic lung adenocarcinoma (lingula)\n\nManagement:\t15 Jan 2024 Left upper lobectomy\n\t\t02 Feb 2024 Stereotactic radiosurgery to right frontal metastasis\n\t\t20 Feb 2024 Commenced Osimertinib\n\nHistology:\tModerately differentiated adenocarcinoma, EGFR exon 19 deletion positive, ROS1 negative\n\nCurrent Situation:\tMDT review of response assessment\n\nI am writing following today's Lung Cancer MDT discussion of [redacted name]'s case. The MDT reviewed the recent imaging performed at the 8-week assessment point on Osimertinib. CT chest shows stable appearances of the post-surgical changes in the left upper lobe. MRI brain demonstrates complete response of the previously treated right frontal metastasis with no new intracranial disease. Blood tests show stable biochemistry and normal liver function.\n\nThe patient is tolerating Osimertinib 80mg daily well with only grade 1 rash and mild diarrhea, both managed with supportive measures. Performance status remains 1.\n\nThe MDT recommendations are to continue with Osimertinib at current dose with next response assessment at 16 weeks. We will arrange CT chest/abdomen/pelvis and MRI brain for mid-June 2024. The patient will be reviewed in clinic in 4 weeks with blood tests including renal function.",
