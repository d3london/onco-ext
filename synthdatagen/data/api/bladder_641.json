  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMuscle invasive bladder cancer (T2aN0M0)\n\tTransurethral resection of bladder tumour March 2024\n\tHistology: High-grade urothelial carcinoma with muscularis propria invasion\n\tFGFR mutation positive on molecular testing\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today in follow-up clinic following completion of cycle 3 of neoadjuvant gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy. He is tolerating treatment well with only grade 1 fatigue and occasional nausea well controlled with standard antiemetics. His renal function remains stable with latest eGFR 68ml/min. Performance status remains 0.\n\nOn examination, there are no concerning features. Recent cystoscopy on 15/4/24 shows no visible residual disease. CT chest/abdomen/pelvis performed last week demonstrates stable appearances with no evidence of metastatic disease.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with final cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy next week. I have discussed the case with [redacted name] from urology, and radical cystectomy is provisionally scheduled for June 2024, approximately 6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy. We will see him again in clinic following surgery to discuss adjuvant treatment options, including potential FGFR inhibitor therapy given the positive mutation status.",
