  "content": "I was very pleased to see [redacted name] in follow-up clinic today following his partial nephrectomy for clear cell renal cell carcinoma. He has made an excellent recovery from surgery performed on March 15th 2024, with his wound healing well and minimal residual discomfort. His energy levels have significantly improved over the past month, and he has gradually returned to his regular walking routine.\n\nTo recap, he underwent robotic partial right nephrectomy for a 5.8cm lower pole mass, with final histology confirming a grade 2 clear cell renal cell carcinoma, stage pT2aN0M0. Margins were clear at 4mm. Molecular testing revealed a TERT promoter mutation. His post-operative period was uncomplicated, and his renal function has remained stable with creatinine at 92 umol/L.\n\nOn examination today, his surgical sites are well-healed, and his blood pressure is well-controlled at 132/78. He reports no new symptoms of concern. He is managing well with regular paracetamol only for occasional mild discomfort. His mood is positive, and he is looking forward to returning to work next week.\n\nI have arranged his first surveillance CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for 3 months' time, and we will see him back in clinic with these results. I have explained the surveillance protocol, and he understands to contact us sooner if he develops any new concerning symptoms. His wife attended today's consultation and they both expressed good understanding of the follow-up plan.",
