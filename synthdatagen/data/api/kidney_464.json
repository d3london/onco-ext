  "content": "Diagnosis:\nPapillary renal cell carcinoma type 2, right kidney\n\nStaging:\npT2N0M0 (AJCC 8th edition)\nMET mutation positive\nDiagnosis confirmed 12 March 2024\n\nPrevious medical history:\nHypertension\nType 2 diabetes\n\nCurrent medications:\nAmlodipine 10mg daily\nMetformin 1g twice daily\nRamipril 5mg daily\n\nAllergies:\nNone known\n\nCurrent situation:\nPost right radical nephrectomy performed 12 March 2024\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today following his recent right radical nephrectomy. The surgery was uncomplicated and he has made an excellent recovery. His wound has healed well and he reports minimal post-operative pain. His blood pressure is well controlled on current medications.\n\nHistopathology confirms a 9cm type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma with negative margins. There is no lymphovascular invasion. Molecular testing has identified a MET mutation. Staging CT chest/abdomen/pelvis shows no evidence of metastatic disease.\n\nPerformance status is 0. Current blood results show stable renal function with creatinine 110, normal liver function, and hemoglobin 125.\n\nGiven the high-risk features of his tumor (type 2 histology, size >7cm) but absence of metastatic disease, I have discussed the role of adjuvant therapy. We will refer his case to next week's renal MDT for discussion of potential adjuvant targeted therapy options. I have explained that current evidence for adjuvant therapy is limited but may be considered given his tumor characteristics.\n\nPlan:\n1. MDT referral completed\n2. Repeat CT chest/abdomen/pelvis in 3 months\n3. Review in clinic with MDT outcome in 2 weeks\n4. Continue current medications\n5. Blood pressure monitoring with GP",
