  "content": "Diagnosis:\nLocally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (poorly cohesive type)\nStage T3N2M0 at diagnosis January 2024\nPDL1 CPS 8, MMR proficient\n\nPrevious treatment:\nNeoadjuvant FLOT chemotherapy commenced February 2024\nCompleted 3 cycles to date\n\nCurrent medications:\nOndansetron 8mg BD\nDexamethasone 4mg BD days 1-3 of each cycle\nPantoprazole 40mg OD\n\nCurrent situation:\nPre-cycle 4 FLOT assessment\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today prior to cycle 4 FLOT chemotherapy. The third cycle was generally well tolerated with only grade 1 fatigue and mild peripheral neuropathy affecting fingertips. His appetite has improved since the dose reduction of 5-FU implemented at cycle 3, and his weight has stabilized at 72kg. Performance status remains 1.\n\nOn examination today, the epigastric mass is no longer palpable suggesting good clinical response. Latest bloods show stable parameters with hemoglobin 11.2, neutrophils 2.8, platelets 156. LFTs and renal function remain normal.\n\nEndoscopic assessment last week showed good partial response with reduction in primary tumor bulk. CT scan is scheduled prior to cycle 6 to formally assess response.\n\nThe plan is to proceed with cycle 4 FLOT today at current doses. We will continue with primary GCSF prophylaxis. [redacted name] will be reviewed again before cycle 5 in three weeks' time.",
