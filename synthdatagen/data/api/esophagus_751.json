He completed treatment on 15/3/24 and has made a good recovery from the acute side effects. His swallowing has significantly improved and he is managing a soft diet without requiring supplementary nutrition. Weight has stabilized at 72kg. He denies any new symptoms and maintains PS 1. Clinical examination today was unremarkable.\n\nI have arranged a surveillance CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for 3 months' time and will review him with the results. I have provided advice regarding red flag symptoms and contact details for the support team if needed before the next appointment.",
