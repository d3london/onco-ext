  "content": "Diagnosis:\tMetastatic bladder cancer (signet ring cell variant)\n\nManagement:\t15 Jan 2024 Diagnostic cystoscopy and TURBT\n\t\t02 Feb 2024 - 15 Mar 2024 Gemcitabine/Cisplatin chemotherapy\n\t\t20 Mar 2024 Palliative peritoneal drain insertion\n\nHistology:\tPoorly differentiated signet ring cell carcinoma with extensive lymphovascular invasion, ERCC2 mutation positive\n\nCurrent Situation:\tProgressive disease with deteriorating performance status\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] today, who attended with his wife. Unfortunately, his condition has significantly deteriorated over the past three weeks. He reports worsening abdominal distention and early satiety, requiring increasing doses of his anti-emetics. His mobility has declined significantly, and he now requires a wheelchair for anything more than very short distances. His performance status has declined from ECOG 2 to ECOG 3.\n\nHis most recent CT scan from 18/4/24 shows progressive peritoneal disease with new omental cake and increasing ascites, despite three cycles of gemcitabine/cisplatin. There is also new small volume pulmonary metastatic disease. His renal function has deteriorated with creatinine rising to 156 μmol/L, likely due to progressive retroperitoneal disease.\n\nHe has required three therapeutic paracenteses over the past month for symptomatic relief, with the most recent performed yesterday draining 4.2L. His albumin has dropped to 28 g/L despite nutritional supplementation.\n\nGiven his declining performance status and disease progression on first-line chemotherapy, we had a detailed discussion about prognosis and future care options. While enfortumab vedotin would typically be considered as second-line therapy, his current performance status makes him unsuitable for further systemic treatment.\n\nI have therefore made an urgent referral to the palliative care team and arranged for community support. We will arrange regular paracentesis as needed for symptom control. His wife expressed concerns about managing at home, so I have also referred to the district nursing team for additional support.\n\nWe will review him again in two weeks' time, or sooner if needed through our acute oncology service. I have provided them with contact details and symptoms to watch for. In the meantime, I have increased his dexamethasone to 4mg twice daily and added metoclopramide as required for nausea.",
