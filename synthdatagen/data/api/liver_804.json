  "content": "Diagnosis:\tHepatocellular carcinoma, clear cell variant\n\nManagement:\tRight hepatectomy March 2023\n\tAdjuvant sorafenib commenced May 2023\n\nHistology:\tClear cell variant HCC, CD10 and vimentin positive\n\nCurrent Situation:\tRoutine follow-up on sorafenib maintenance\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] in clinic today for routine follow-up. She continues on sorafenib maintenance therapy which she is tolerating well with only grade 1 palmar-plantar syndrome requiring regular moisturizing. Her most recent CT chest and abdomen from last month shows stable appearances of the two small lung nodules (largest 8mm) with no new lesions identified. Liver function tests remain within normal range. Performance status remains 0 and she continues to work full-time. She denies any new symptoms. The plan is to continue current dose of sorafenib and arrange repeat imaging in 3 months. We will review her again following these scans.",
