She has managed the previous cycle relatively well with only grade 1 nausea and mild fatigue lasting 5 days. The initial neutropenic sepsis after cycle 1 has not recurred since starting GCSF prophylaxis. Her surgical wounds have healed well.?\n\nOn examination today there is no evidence of local recurrence. The right chest wall shows good healing. The left breast shows expected post-surgical and radiotherapy changes only.? Blood results are satisfactory for proceeding with treatment.?\n\nWe will proceed with cycle 4 today and review again in 3 weeks. The breast care nurse will contact her by telephone next week to check on side effects.",
