Malignant pleural mesothelioma (biphasic type)\n\tDate of diagnosis\n\tJanuary 2024\n\n\tTreatment aim\n\tPalliative\n\n\tSummary of completed treatment and relevant dates\n\n\tSurgery\n\t12 Jan 2024 Video-assisted thoracoscopic pleural biopsy\n\n\tChemotherapy\n\t1. Carboplatin/Pemetrexed - 2 cycles completed (Jan-Feb 2024)\n\t2. Nivolumab commenced March 2024\n\n\tClinical studies\n\tNone\n\n\tCurrent disease status\n\tProgressive disease with worsening pleural effusion\n\n\tCurrent issues\n\t1. Increasing dyspnoea\n\t2. Right-sided chest pain\n\t3. Progressive weight loss\n\n\tSummary of consultation\n\tThis 68-year-old gentleman with biphasic mesothelioma has unfortunately shown disease progression despite first-line chemotherapy. Initial diagnosis followed investigation of right-sided pleural effusion, with VATS biopsy confirming biphasic mesothelioma (PD-L1 TPS 60%). He completed 2 cycles of carboplatin/pemetrexed but developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia requiring admission. CT showed progressive disease with increasing pleural mass and effusion.\n\nHe commenced second-line nivolumab in March 2024 but has shown clinical deterioration with worsening dyspnoea, now requiring 3L oxygen at rest. Recent CT shows further progression with extensive pleural disease and increasing effusion despite recent therapeutic aspiration.\n\nPerformance status has declined to ECOG 3. He requires assistance with most activities of daily living and spends >50% of time in bed. Weight has dropped from 82kg to 74kg over 8 weeks despite nutritional supplements.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tUrgent CT scan arranged for next week\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tOxycodone MR 30mg BD\nPregabalin 75mg BD\nDexamethasone 4mg OD\n\n\tFollow up\n\tUrgent referral made to local palliative care team\nTransfer of care to [redacted name] Hospital palliative care unit arranged\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPlease monitor oxygen requirements and adjust PRN medications as needed\nPlease support palliative care referral",
