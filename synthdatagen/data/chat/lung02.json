    "content": "Diagnosis:\tStage IIIA (T3 N2 M0) left upper lobe pulmonary adenocarcinoma.\t\nMolecular profile: EGFR/KRAS wild type, ALK and ROS1 fusion negative, PD-L1 expression <1%.\n\nSummary:\tInitial imaging September 2024 - CT thorax identified 4.2cm left upper lobe mass.\nOctober 2024 - PET-CT demonstrated FDG-avid primary lesion (SUV 12.4) with ipsilateral mediastinal node involvement.\nEBUS-guided biopsy of station 4L confirmed adenocarcinoma.\n\t\tCommenced on platinum-doublet chemotherapy with Carboplatin/Pemetrexed.\n\nSignificant PMH:\nPoorly controlled type 2 diabetes with peripheral neuropathy\nChronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation\n\nI reviewed [redacted name] in clinic today prior to cycle 3 Carboplatin/Pemetrexed. Treatment had been delayed by one week due to missed pre-chemotherapy assessment. He reports generally managing well with the current regime despite some ongoing side effects.\n\nHis main symptoms include grade 2 fatigue which typically peaks days 5-7 post-chemotherapy. He describes intermittent low-grade nausea, well controlled with as-needed ondansetron. His baseline dyspnea remains stable, mainly noticeable on moderate exertion. He maintains reasonable oral intake though notes early satiety. Denies any fevers, night sweats, or new respiratory symptoms. Reports good compliance with supportive medications including dexamethasone and folic acid supplementation.\n\nOf note, he has developed a patchy erythematous rash across his upper trunk, first noticed after cycle 2. The rash is non-pruritic and appears to wax and wane. No associated systemic symptoms.\n\nOn examination today, performance status remains 1. Chest auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds in the left upper zone but no added sounds. The reported trunk rash presents as scattered erythematous macules, blanching, predominantly across the anterior chest wall. No evidence of infection or cellulitis.\n\nDiscussed with Dr [redacted name] regarding timing of concurrent radiotherapy. Given current attendance issues, we will continue with chemotherapy alone for now, aiming to optimize treatment compliance before introducing concurrent radiotherapy. Today's bloods show stable parameters suitable for proceeding with cycle 3.\n\nPlan to continue with cycle 3 chemotherapy today. Will review in 3 weeks pre-cycle 4. If rash persists, will arrange dermatology assessment. Have reinforced importance of attending all scheduled appointments.",
