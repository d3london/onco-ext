Unfortunately, her most recent CT scan from 15/05/2024 shows clear evidence of disease progression with new peritoneal deposits and the development of three new liver metastases, the largest measuring 3.2cm. Her CA125 has risen from 450 to 1200 over the past six weeks. She has required three therapeutic paracenteses for symptomatic ascites since our last review.\n\nHer performance status has declined to ECOG 3, spending most of the day resting due to fatigue. She has ongoing grade 2 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia from Caelyx and grade 2 peripheral neuropathy from previous taxane therapy. Her appetite has significantly decreased with early satiety, though she denies nausea. Weight has dropped by 4kg since last review.\n\nGiven the clear evidence of disease progression and declining performance status, we have had a detailed discussion about moving to best supportive care. [redacted name] and her family understand the situation but would like to explore the option of further systemic therapy. We have discussed the very low likelihood of response to fifth-line treatment and the risks of further deterioration.\n\n\tFurther investigations\n\tUrgent CT guided drainage of ascites\nLiver function tests and clotting\n\n\tMedication prescribed\n\tDexamethasone 4mg daily\nIncreased Oxycontin to 40mg BD\n\n\tFollow up\n\tUrgent referral to palliative care team\nReview in one week with blood results\n\n\tRequired GP actions\n\tPlease monitor renal function\nConsider community palliative care referral",
