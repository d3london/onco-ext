  "content": "Thank you for referring this patient regarding right upper limb lymphedema which developed following treatment for grade III invasive ductal carcinoma with extensive lymphovascular invasion.\n\nThe patient underwent right mastectomy in March 2021, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy which was completed in August 2021, and radiotherapy completed in October 2021. She completed one year of adjuvant Trastuzumab therapy.\n\nRelevant medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring oral hypoglycemic agents, and migraine which is well controlled with prophylactic therapy. She has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease managed with regular proton pump inhibitor.\n\n[redacted name] reports allergies to penicillin (causing angioedema) and ibuprofen (gastric irritation).\n\nCurrent medications include metformin 1g twice daily, propranolol 80mg daily, omeprazole 20mg daily, and amitriptyline 10mg at night for migraine prophylaxis.\n\n\tAssessment findings\n\tExamination of the right upper limb demonstrated intact skin with moderate non-pitting edema extending from the dorsum of the hand to the upper arm. Tissue fibrosis was noted particularly in the lateral upper arm region.\n\nSkin temperature was symmetrical with no evidence of infection. Stemmer sign was positive in all digits.\n\nThe mastectomy site showed well-healed surgical scarring with moderate tissue induration in the lateral chest wall.\n\nRange of movement assessment: Right shoulder flexion limited to 110 degrees, abduction to 95 degrees. Left shoulder movement within normal limits. Elbow and wrist movements full range bilaterally.\n\nPatient reported constant heaviness and occasional sharp discomfort, VAS score 5-6/10, particularly noticeable during overhead activities.\n\nBioimpedance analysis showed 18% volume difference compared to the contralateral limb.\n\n\tDiagnosis based on clinical presentation\n\tSevere stage II lymphedema affecting the right upper limb, with established fibrotic changes. Associated moderate lymphedema changes noted in the lateral chest wall region.\n\n\tTreatment aim and management plan\n\tCommence intensive decongestive lymphedema therapy incorporating manual lymphatic drainage and reduced-tension bandaging. Patient to be instructed in modified self-lymphatic drainage techniques.\n\nPrescription of Class III flat-knit compression sleeve with separate gauntlet. Nocturnal compression recommended given severity of symptoms.\n\n\tSummary of programme of care\n\tPatient has attended comprehensive lymphedema education workshop. Detailed guidance provided regarding skincare, exercise modification, and compression garment maintenance.\n\nCompression therapy protocol established: Class III (34-46mmHg) flat-knit sleeve with separate gauntlet to be worn continuously during day. Additional night-time compression garment prescribed. Three sets of garments arranged to ensure consistent compression.\n\nDetailed instruction provided in modified self-lymphatic drainage protocol for twice-daily implementation.\n\n\tSigns and symptoms indicative of cellulitis requiring urgent GP assessment\n\t1. Sudden onset of increased swelling with tenderness\n1. Skin redness or discoloration\n1. Increased local temperature\n1. Systemic symptoms including fever\n1. General malaise\n1. Increased tissue tension with pain\n\nCellulitis risk factors include skin breaks, insect bites, or underlying infection. Prompt recognition and intervention is crucial.\n\nPlease refer to updated LSN guidelines for management of lymphedema-associated cellulitis.\n\n\tSupport needed with ongoing management in the community\n\tCurrent treatment plan is adequate with planned monitoring. No additional community support indicated at present.\n\n\tAlert Symptoms requiring oncology team contact:\n\t1. New lumps or nodules\n1. Uncontrolled progressive pain\n1. Unexpected rapid volume increase\n1. New neurological symptoms\n\n\tAlert Symptoms requiring lymphedema team contact:\n\t1. Compression garment problems\n1. Poor volume control despite adherence\n1. Recurrent infections\n1. Difficulty maintaining self-management\n\nFollow-up arranged in six weeks for treatment response assessment. Patient informed to contact the clinic earlier if complications develop.",
