She reports generally stable health with no new concerning symptoms. Her exercise tolerance remains satisfactory though she notes occasional dyspnea on moderate exertion. Her main current issue is an acute gout flare affecting her right ankle, currently being managed with colchicine and a reducing course of prednisolone.\n\nOn examination today, there is a persistent left supraclavicular node measuring approximately 2.0 x 1.8cm. The patient believes this may have enlarged over the past three weeks, though she is uncertain. No additional lymphadenopathy identified. Chest auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds at the right base but no added sounds. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable. Abdominal examination shows no organomegaly or tenderness. No peripheral edema noted.\n\nGiven the possibility of lymph node enlargement post-chemotherapy completion, I have arranged urgent restaging CT imaging. Her fitness would allow for further intervention if disease progression is confirmed. Blood tests will be repeated today - noting her most recent hemoglobin was 9.2 which was clinically well tolerated.\n\nWe will review her in clinic in three weeks with the scan results.",
