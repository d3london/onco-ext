She attended Acute Oncology services last week reporting new onset left-sided ptosis and diplopia, necessitating postponement of scheduled paclitaxel treatment.?\n\nOn examination, there is partial left third nerve palsy with pupillary sparing and mild ptosis. Urgent MRI brain revealed a solitary 2.1cm enhancing lesion in the left cavernous sinus with local mass effect. She was started on dexamethasone 4mg three times daily with marked improvement in symptoms.? Now maintained on 4mg twice daily.?\n\nGiven the isolated nature of this intracranial disease and ongoing systemic disease control elsewhere, we have discussed stereotactic radiosurgery as a local treatment option. This will require careful consideration of dose constraints given her extensive treatment history. Today's paclitaxel will proceed as planned, and her case will be discussed at next week's Neuro-Oncology MDT. A dedicated radiotherapy planning consultation will be arranged thereafter.? Formal response assessment imaging is scheduled after completion of cycle 12.",
