He reports gradually worsening right-sided back pain, currently rated 4/10 and requiring regular paracetamol, though remains ambulatory without any concerning neurological symptoms.\n\nI have discussed his case with Dr [redacted name] regarding potential eligibility for the METEOR-2 trial of dual checkpoint inhibition. While awaiting confirmation of trial screening, we are also planning for potential second-line vinorelbine if trial participation is not possible.\n\nWe have arranged to review him in clinic in 3 weeks? time with trial screening outcome. If trial participation is not feasible, we will proceed with chemotherapy initiation at that visit.",
