Unfortunately, recent imaging demonstrates disease progression with new bone metastases in the thoracic spine and pelvis, along with a suspicious 2.1cm lesion in segment 7 of the liver. Relevant imaging reports are attached.\n\nAt today's consultation, [redacted name] reports preserved appetite but acknowledges a 6kg weight loss over the past 6 weeks. His bowel function remains normal and urinary symptoms are well-controlled on current medication. While his previous thoracic pain has improved on transdermal buprenorphine 10mcg/hr, he describes new onset right shoulder pain significantly limiting overhead activities.\n\n[redacted name]'s primary concern is progressive weakness in both legs. This developed gradually over 8 weeks, and his walking distance has declined from unlimited to approximately 100 meters. He describes associated paresthesia in both feet, particularly noticeable at night.\n\nWe discussed his disease progression and treatment options. Given that he has now received all standard therapies for castrate-resistant disease except for chemotherapy, we reviewed the role of docetaxel treatment. Information about chemotherapy side effects and monitoring requirements has been provided. Recent blood tests revealed hemoglobin of 98 g/L and platelets of 89 x 10^9/L, necessitating transfusion support with two units of packed red cells.\n\n[redacted name] has an upcoming appointment with [redacted name], but given his clinical deterioration, I would be grateful if this could be expedited.",
