Progressive skin rash affecting face and upper trunk, grade 2 severity\n? Intermittent diarrhea (2-3 episodes daily)\n? Mild paronychia affecting both thumbs\n? Occasional dry cough, improved from baseline\n? Reduced exercise tolerance but able to manage daily activities\n? Early satiety with 3kg weight loss over 2 months\n? Persistent fatigue requiring afternoon rest\n? Mild peripheral edema\n? No hemoptysis\n? No chest pain\n\nCurrent Medications:\nOsimertinib 80mg daily\nDoxycycline 100mg daily for rash\nLoperamide as required\nLevothyroxine 75mcg daily\n\nPerformance Status = 1\n\nExamination:\n? Papulopustular rash affecting face and upper chest\n? Mild paronychia of thumbnails\n? No peripheral lymphadenopathy\n? Chest clear on auscultation\n? O2 saturation 96% on air\n? Heart rate 88 regular\n? Temperature 37.2Â°C\n? Blood pressure 128/76\n? Mild bilateral ankle edema\n? No clinical evidence of disease progression\n\nRecent Investigations:\nBlood tests show stable biochemistry and mild normocytic anemia\nCT thorax (10.08.2023) demonstrates maintained partial response with reduction in primary mass and stable contralateral nodules\n\nPlan:\n? Continue osimertinib at current dose\n? Increase doxycycline to twice daily for rash management\n? Dietary advice given for diarrhea control\n? Review in 4 weeks with repeat blood tests\n?
