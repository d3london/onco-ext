    "content": "Diagnosis:\nExtensive stage small cell lung cancer\n(Screen failure for ILLUMINATE-301 trial due to concurrent immunosuppressive therapy)\n\nTumour history:\nTransferred to [redacted name] Hospital in January 2024 with massive right pleural effusion and acute kidney injury secondary to third-spacing. Underwent emergency thoracoscopic biopsy by Dr [redacted name]: histopathology confirmed small cell lung cancer with extensive pleural involvement.\nFirst cycle of palliative Carboplatin/Etoposide chemotherapy administered 15/01/2024 (inpatient).\n\nSecond cycle 12/02/2024, delivered during subsequent admission for symptom management.\n\nComplications:\nImmune-mediated interstitial nephritis, probable paraneoplastic phenomenon.\n\nIncidental finding of Aspergillus on bronchial washings, considered colonization as galactomannan negative.\n\nPast History:\nChronic immune thrombocytopenia on maintenance prednisolone, poorly controlled hypertension, previous DVT on rivaroxaban.\n\nI wish to update you regarding [redacted name]. This patient had an extended admission in February. To summarize, [redacted name] was admitted to [redacted name] Hospital for planned thoracoscopic pleurodesis, as despite initial chemotherapy response, there was inadequate control of right pleural effusion after cycle one. During this admission, the patient developed progressive peripheral edema. Lower limb doppler ultrasound was negative for DVT. Urinary protein studies confirmed significant proteinuria with nephrotic range protein excretion. This was attributed to immune-mediated interstitial nephritis, likely paraneoplastic, though biopsy was deferred given overall clinical status.\n\nUnfortunately, attempted pleurodesis was unsuccessful in controlling the effusion. An indwelling pleural catheter was subsequently placed. Additionally, bronchial washings grew Aspergillus species. After infectious disease consultation with Dr [redacted name], this was determined to represent colonization given negative galactomannan and clinical picture. The second cycle of chemotherapy was administered during the admission, and discharge was achieved on 15 February. [redacted name] will be reviewed in Thoracic Oncology Clinic on 1 March 2024, with concurrent thoracic surgery assessment regarding pleural catheter removal.\n\n[redacted name] understands the challenging nature of treatment, particularly given the immune-mediated renal complications. If renal function shows significant deterioration following cycle two, careful consideration will be needed regarding fitness for further systemic therapy. Chest imaging is scheduled for the upcoming clinic visit, and we hope to see both treatment response and improvement in the nephritis pattern.",
