He describes worsening abdominal discomfort and anorexia over the past few weeks, associated with a significant weight loss of 5kg. On examination, he appears fatigued but is able to mobilize short distances with assistance. Abdominal examination reveals mild distension but no palpable masses. Recent CT imaging confirms disease progression, with increasing liver tumor burden and new retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. \n\nGiven his deteriorating performance status and progression on prior therapies, we discussed options for further treatment. Given the presence of KRAS mutation, systemic therapy with trifluridine/tipiracil was proposed as the next line of care. Supportive measures for symptom control were also reviewed.\n\nPlan:\t\tInitiate trifluridine/tipiracil starting April 2024, with close monitoring for toxicity\n\t\t\tProvide nutritional support and optimize symptom control with analgesics\n\t\t\tPlan reassessment with CT scan after 2 cycles to evaluate response\n\t\t\tArrange palliative care referral to support symptom management and quality of life\n",
