His general condition remains satisfactory with no significant chemotherapy-related toxicities reported. Performance status is maintained at 1.\n\nHe has recently completed a course of ciprofloxacin for complicated urinary tract infection, with good clinical response after 7 days of therapy.\n\nThe predominant clinical issue remains right-sided sciatica-type pain. Recent bone scintigraphy and plain radiographs have not demonstrated clear evidence of skeletal metastases, though given the persistent symptoms, we will proceed with dedicated MRI lumbar spine and pelvis for further evaluation.\n\nClinical examination today was unremarkable. Chest was clear to auscultation. No palpable lymphadenopathy. No focal neurological deficits identified.\n\nProviding today's blood results are satisfactory, we will proceed with cycle 2 chemotherapy as scheduled next week. Follow-up arranged in three weeks with repeat biochemistry and PSA measurement. The patient has emergency contact details and understands to report any concerning symptoms promptly.",
