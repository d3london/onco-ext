KRAS mutant.?\n\nTreatment:\t\tTotal mesorectal excision April 2015 with partial hepatectomy for synchronous liver metastases.?\n\t\t\tCompleted adjuvant CAPOX June 2015.?\n\t\t\tProgression noted in February 2018 with new pulmonary metastases; started on FOLFOX with bevacizumab.?\n\t\t\tDiscontinued FOLFOX December 2019 due to neurotoxicity.?\n\t\t\tInitiated nivolumab as part of clinical trial March 2020; ceased June 2022 following progression.?\n\t\t\tRecent imaging August 2024 showed progression in hepatic lesions and new peritoneal implants.?\n\n[redacted name] attended today's clinic reporting significant fatigue and difficulty managing daily tasks, requiring increased use of home aids. He describes ongoing right-sided abdominal pain, rated 6/10, managed with regular paracetamol and occasional tramadol. His appetite is reduced with a 4kg weight loss over 3 months.?\n\nExamination revealed mild pallor, no jaundice, and moderate ascites with tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Performance status has declined to ECOG 2.?\n\nRecent Investigations:\n? CT August 2024: Progression in liver metastases (largest lesion 3.5cm â†’ 5.2cm) and new peritoneal disease.?\n? CEA risen from 23 to 78 over 4 months.?\n? Bloods show mild hypoalbuminemia (32g/L) and elevated alkaline phosphatase (185U/L).?\n\nPlan:\n? Discontinue current therapy (irinotecan-based) due to progression.?\n? Initiate regorafenib with dose escalation protocol.?\n? Prescribe spironolactone 50mg daily for ascites management.?\n? Refer to palliative care for quality-of-life support and symptom management.?\n? Schedule repeat CT abdomen/pelvis in 8 weeks to assess response.?\n? Follow-up clinic visit in 3 weeks for regorafenib tolerance assessment.",
