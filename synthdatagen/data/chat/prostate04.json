His PSA has unfortunately shown significant progression to 892 (from 584 in December 2024). He reports no lower urinary tract symptoms or bone pain. His appetite remains reasonable though he notes increasing fatigue and general decline in function. He now spends most of the day in his chair or bed.\n\nI have explained that the rising PSA indicates failure of prednisolone to control his disease progression. Given his current performance status of 3, he is not a candidate for systemic chemotherapy. Following discussion with [redacted name], we will adjust his treatment to dexamethasone 0.5mg twice daily. We will arrange follow-up in 12 weeks with repeat PSA measurement.",
