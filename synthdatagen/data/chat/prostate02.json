His clinical condition remains excellent.\n\nToday's PSA results are pending but his previous reading showed continued biochemical response. Liver function tests and full blood count are within normal range.\n\nHe reports occasional peripheral neuropathy affecting his feet, likely residual from previous chemotherapy, which is adequately controlled with gabapentin.\n\nI have provided a prescription for ongoing darolutamide and planned review in clinic in 3 months with interval PSA monitoring.",
