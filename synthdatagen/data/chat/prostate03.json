We are awaiting PSMA-PET staging. Of particular concern, he describes progressive fatigue over 4 months with unexplained weight loss of 8kg. He reports early satiety and intermittent epigastric discomfort, though no frank nausea or vomiting. His bowel habit has remained unchanged.\n\nI enclose my recent assessment letter for your reference.",
