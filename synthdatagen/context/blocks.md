# Oncology Letter Contents

This section outlines common content found within oncology clinic letters. Content is described via thematic 'blocks', which may include: ['cancer_diagnosis', 'treatment', 'disease_status', 'patient_status', 'medical_background', 'social_background', 'clinical_trial', 'care_plan', 'administrative']. Most letters will contain only a limited set of blocks, occuring in different orders. Blocks may be repeated (for example there may be various administrative blocks scattered throughout a letter)

Each block, in turn, are structured through sequential 'subblocks'. When a block appears in a letter, it will usually only contain only a limited set of valid subblocks, in varying orders. The same block may appear multiple times in a letter, with different subblocks each time.
