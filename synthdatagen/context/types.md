# Oncology Clinic Letter Types

This document provides descriptions of types of oncology clinic letter, to support automated generation of synthetic letters.

### Type 1: Initial Assessment
This letter documents the first specialist assessment of a new cancer diagnosis. Provide comprehensive cancer details, relevant past medical history, social circumstances, and initial treatment recommendations. The letter should build a complete picture of the patient's situation and clearly outline the proposed treatment pathway. Include any specific patient concerns or preferences discussed.

### Type 2: Simple Follow-up
This letter documents a routine follow-up visit for a patient with previously treated cancer who is now on surveillance. The letter should focus on confirming disease status (typically stable/no evidence of recurrence), current patient wellbeing, and ongoing surveillance plan. Include basic disease background but emphasize current status and forward-looking elements. The tone should be reassuring while maintaining clinical precision.

### Type 3: Treatment Review
This letter captures an assessment during active treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted therapy). Focus on treatment tolerance, side effects, response assessment, and decisions about continuing/modifying treatment. Include relevant blood results or imaging findings that inform treatment decisions. The letter should clearly document any treatment modifications and rationale.

### Type 4: Complex Initial Assessment
This letter provides a comprehensive first assessment of a complex case, possibly including multiple comorbidities, challenging social circumstances, or complicated cancer presentation. Include detailed assessment of all relevant factors that might impact treatment decisions. The letter should demonstrate careful consideration of competing factors in reaching treatment recommendations.

### Type 5: Multiple Cancer
This letter manages a patient with multiple cancer diagnoses (either synchronous or metachronous). Clearly differentiate between the different cancers, their respective treatments, and current status. Prioritize the most active/relevant cancer while maintaining appropriate surveillance of all conditions. The letter should demonstrate clear thinking about how the different cancers impact each other's management.

### Type 6: Clinical Trial Registration
This letter documents enrollment in a clinical trial, including eligibility confirmation, trial-specific assessments, and baseline measurements. Detail the trial protocol, patient understanding, and any trial-specific requirements. The letter should serve as a formal record of trial initiation while maintaining standard clinical care elements.

### Type 7: Clinical Trial Assessment
This letter details assessment of a patient enrolled in a clinical trial, focusing on protocol-specific assessments, treatment response, and toxicity monitoring. Include trial-specific measurements and criteria, any protocol modifications, and clear documentation of trial-related decisions. The letter should maintain a balance between standard care elements and trial-specific requirements.

### Type 8: MDT Outcome
This letter communicates the outcome of a multidisciplinary team discussion. Focus on the specific questions posed to the MDT, the evidence/investigations reviewed, the conclusions reached, and the resulting recommendations. Include relevant specialty input and clearly document the agreed treatment plan. The letter should serve as a formal record of the MDT decision.

### Type 9: Treatment Change
This letter documents a significant change in treatment strategy, such as switching chemotherapy regimens or changing treatment intent. Clearly explain the rationale for change, including relevant disease assessments, patient factors, and evidence base for new treatment. The letter should provide clear documentation of the decision-making process and discussion with the patient.

### Type 10: End of Treatment
This letter marks completion of a defined treatment course, summarizing treatment delivered, response achieved, and ongoing care plan. Include any remaining toxicities, surveillance plan, and criteria for re-assessment. The letter should serve as a clear transition document between treatment phases.

### Type 11: Complex Progressive Disease
This letter manages disease progression requiring significant treatment changes, possibly including transition to palliative care. Address disease status, symptom management, psychosocial support, and modified treatment goals. The letter should demonstrate holistic care planning while maintaining clinical precision about disease status.

### Type 12: Transfer of Care
This letter facilitates transfer of care between facilities or teams, providing comprehensive summary of diagnosis, treatments, current status, and ongoing plans. Include all relevant details needed for seamless care continuation. The letter should serve as a complete standalone document for the receiving team while maintaining clear ongoing care recommendations.
